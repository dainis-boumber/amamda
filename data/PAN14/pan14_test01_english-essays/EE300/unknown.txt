To have god knowledge of the English language is the same that the rest of the world is wide open for you. 
I love to travel and to meet other people and visit other culture, that is one of the reasons why I would like to get a god English. 
I feel confident in talking the language; it does not matter if I attend a discussion in political subjects, a debate of larger environmental problem or just a simple road description. 
I understand well what people are telling me and I think that they understand me pretty well too. 
If I not understand what they say I will never hesitate to ask what they mean and the problem will always be solved. 
My biggest problem is my pronunciation, I have some kind of American English with a lot of slang that I think I have picked up from not so good films and TV programs. 
I am aware of that I am using both word from British English and American English and perhaps even some Australian expressions as one of my friends are from Australia. 
I am trying to improve my pronunciation with help from my brother, who lives and works in U.S. and from his American wife who are studying at Bearkly University and uses an "academic" language. 
I think people in Sweden has the same problems as I have with the pronunciation, caused by all the American soap operas and crime series on TV, with a very narrow language badly pronounced. 
That is another reason why I would like to get a god British English, not only for my on sake but also for my future pupils. 
After all I am studying to become a teacher in the English language or will I become an American-English language teacher?  
I also read allot of texts, books and magazines. 
I read very easily, almost in the same tempo as my first language - Swedish- but when I read technical texts I often have to consult a dictionary. 
I se this only positive, because in this way I am increasing my vocabulary. 
A special problem I have is that I only know a few English abbreviations. 
Writing English will cause me some problem. 
I have never had any essays writing in school nor have I been writing on my spare time, not even a letter. 
This means that I have some work to attend on this course, but I gladly do it because the language is not only to speak, one has to write it too.  
As I have not studied Latin or Linguistic that will cause me some problems whit the grammar when I have to write in the English language. 
Another problem for me is my spelling, my American pronunciation is leading me to spell the English words the way as I hear them which means that I often mix English and American words and spelling in same sentences. 
I like to be guided in my choice of studying the English language. 
Shall I try to improve my American English or shall I try to gain my most wanted British English? 
One of the reasons that I hesitate and is pondering is that I have experienced that the American English is closer to the spelling roles.
