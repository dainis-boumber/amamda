I've decided to write down my skills in the following order, first my three strengths and last my greatest weakness. 
I'm going to try to explain what I think are my strengths and weaknesses in every subject, and why. 
I'm concluding with a summary of how competent I feel I am today. 
Listening, or understanding is something I think that I'm very good at. 
I have always been good at it. 
I understand most of what I hear. 
To understand the spoken language is something I've never considered a problem. 
I still don't. 
Having heard the Scottish language being spoken a lot has helped me reach the level I am at today. 
I even understood my sister's Irish boyfriend. 
I have always watched television and never cared to make the effort of reading the subtitles. 
I suppose that it is good training. 
I count listening to be the best of my skills. y second best skill is speaking. 
Since I always talk a lot.
I feel that I'm only improving my skills. 
I have never had the problem of being shy. 
My weakness with this skill is the grammar, I speak so fast that I've never bothered with the grammar, my message gets by anyway. 
My strength is my vocabulary, it's big and since I talk a lot I have to use it. 
I have to admit to the fact that it's a little bit rusty right now, but it gets me by. 
I also master the skill of being able to change languages at a moments notice. 
My weak point here is my problem with speaking English to a person who I know speak Swedish. 
The language that I speak then isn't what I would call Swenglish, because I tend to combine Swedish words with English words in the sentences. 
I don't mix the words up as is indicated in the word Swenglish. 
If you in speaking add my pronunciation I have to say I speak quite well without an accent, that is without a Swedish accent. 
People I meet always have trouble guessing where I'm from. 
That's probably not good, if they always guessed America or England I'd at least get my points in the pronunciation class. 
Now we've arrived to the skill of reading. 
I read a lot of novels, preferably long ones. 
I love to get lost in a novel and spend some time with the characters. 
I understand the context even if a few words either pass me by or gets me up out of the couch, looking for a dictionary. 
I can also spot irony and sarcasm most of the time. 
My strength is again my vocabulary and the will to understand. 
I am also quite flexible which helps me when I try to imagine where the words come from and what they mean. 
My weakness is that I usually understand the context anyway so I don't bother to get up and look the word/ words up. 
Which in the end just does me damage and doesn't really expand my vocabulary skills. 
This skill isn't rusty, I've been reading a lot of English books lately, classics and novels.  
The last skill is writing, and that's my weakness. 
The only thing I can remember ever writing in English is an examination essay about Marie Antoinette and that is a long, long time ago. 
I'm not even rusty because I never mastered the skill of writing for real. 
I've written book reports and that's it. 
My experience is built on my personal letters which are few and since I know the people I'm writing to I don't bother with grammar, well it's never to late to start.  
To make a conclusion of my skills, I have to say that the greatest of them is my ability to express what I think and understand what, whom ever I'm making conversation with is trying to express. 
I'm also able to take part in discussions in average subjects. 
I have to say that I think my English is pretty average.
