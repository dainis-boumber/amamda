I write this Essay bekaus it is very important for me to assess my strengths and wecknesses. 
It halps to define my level and make my oun gouls. 
All of the English students have the main goul-to manage this cours. 
Every subject we learn has its oun goul. 
And every individual has his personal goul too, because we have different levels. 
We have different levels in our oun skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. 
In my Essey I will write about my levels in listening, reading, speaking and writing. 
I will define my level, how good or bad I'm at the different skills. 
I will start with speaking because to communicate on the hight level is most important for me. 
It is the question about my self-confidence. 
Speaking helps us to show who we are. 
What we tolk and how we do it makes a pikture of us. 
That is why it so importante for me. 
Now about my problems. 
I have a good vocabulari. 
I am good at understanding, listening and reading. 
But to know words is not enought, to understand people and books contants is not enought.  
To speak with other people on the high level, to be on the hight level in conversation-it is a point for me and my problem. 
When I talk to people I use the words I new during the long time and I can not pick up from my mind the other new words I would like to use in those case. 
I have a problem with picking-up new words from my mind.  
Some times I have dificalties in explanation. 
I feel frustration when I can not explain me in English as well as I do in Swidish or Russian. 
To explain my self well, to tell what I really mean, to send a right messige is very important for me. 
The other people whom I meet every day, do not know me as well as friends. 
In this case they can not appreciate my 'I inside'. 
They take me as I speak. 
They do not know how good I am in Russian and Swedish, how deep I am in my soul and how intelligent in my brain. 
I think that how we speak make some imange av us. 
Our ebility for explonation is so closely tied tu our identity as a person. 
Self-confidence plays a big role in my speaking. 
Wen I am not sure about my self it makes me to speak badly. 
When I have self-confidence I speak better. 
And when I speak better I feel more confidence. y speaking depends av different things: my mood, occasian, people I speak with. 
There are some people I can speak without any problems. 
With some other people having conversation can be more difficult. 
When people do not concentrate on the subject we talk about but just try to find some fouls in my speaking it makes me nervous and I start to think about my grammar and lose my confidence. 
Pronanciatian is my other problem, but not so big. 
I have to remind my self some times to pronance English when I am talking English. 
I am sotisfited with my reading. 
When I read I cath the sense. 
I need not open the dictionari. 
I do it when I want to be sured about my guesses regarding the new words meaning. 
And when I do it I always right, that makes me happy. 
I have to admit that writing is the most difficult skill for me, as you see. 
Most difficult is to start and I know I make a lot of mistakes that makes me feel ashamed. 
When I write I can be in the different levels.   
Conklusion. 
Now I have to end my Composition. 
In this Essay I wrote about all four skills, but mostly I consentrate me on speaking. 
I wrote about importance av assasment my strengths and weaknesses.  
I have to do a big work to solve my problems with English. 
But no pain, no gain! 
I have to praktice. 
Praktice makes perfect. 
I will be satisfited with my life when I will be satisfited with my English.
