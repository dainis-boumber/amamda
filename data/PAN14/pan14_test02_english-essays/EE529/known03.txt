 Parents responsibilities to protect their children from violence on TV  Nowadays there is a lot of violence showing on television. 
This violence is being watched by children of all ages and they are easily influenced by it. 
Therefore there lies a great responsibility with the parents and the broadcasters to prevent children from watching violence on television. 
Since parents are the ones that raise and live with their children I think that the major responsibility lies with them. 
Parents have an amazing power to influence the amount of violence their children watch. 
I will now give my reflection on parents' responsibilities to prevent their children from watching violence on television.  
Firstly, parents should pay close attention to the programs their children are watching. 
Parents can watch some episodes of the programs together with their children so that they will get an idea what the contents of the programs are. 
This way parents will know what their children watch and they will be able to talk about it with them. 
Parents can point out that although an actor/actress has not been injured from multiple hits, cuts or shots such violence in real life would hurt or kill and they can also point out that conflicts can be solved in other ways then by using violence. 
Some children that watch a lot of violence might imitate and use it since they think it is normal to do so.   
Secondly, parents should have a limit on how much time their children are allowed to spend in front of the TV. 
By encouraging their children to occupy themselves with other activities instead, such as sports, hobbies or playing with friends, the amount of time that they spend in front of the TV will decrease as well as the children become less influenced by the violence on TV.   
Thirdly, it should be in every parent's interest to make sure his or her children are not exposed to violence. 
It is important that parents do not let their children watch television on their own since violence might occur and it is difficult for children to select what is appropriate to watch and it certainly is not the children's responsibility to choose what they can and can not watch. 
Whenever there is a violent program on TV parents should refuse to let their children watch it and they should explain to their children why they can not watch the program and then change the channel or turn of the TV.  
Lastly, parents should contact other parents of their children's friends and classmates and try to agree to have similar rules about the period of time and the type of programs that their children are allowed to watch. 
When my brother was ten years old he had a friend that was two years older than he was. 
One day the boy's parents had recorded a film (not suitable for children) from TV, which the boy invited my brother and some other friends to watch the next day. 
Luckily my brother told my mother about the film and she did not let him watch it. 
This is an example of how difficult it can be for parents to control what their children watch when they are at other people's houses.   
Looking at all these different aspects of parents responsibilities (according to me) shows that parents have, by being interested in and aware of their children's well being, a major role to affect what their children watch on TV. 
Parents should act as role models for their children so that their children will take after them and learn not to appreciate violence. 
Although it might not be so easy even though parents try really hard to take on their responsibility.
