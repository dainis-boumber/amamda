y education in English consits of six years in elementary school and the A, B and C course in "gymnasiet". 
The C course was taken voluntarily. 
Moreover, I've taken a three week language course in Brighton, England, in 1995.  	 
I hardly remember anything of the tuition in elementary school, but I don't reckon there was anything extraordinary about it. 
In "gymnasiet" I had a rather hopeless teacher who should've retired a long time ago. 
I can't remember much of his lessens either, except for the fact that he was very keen on letting us discuss different topics in small groups. 
Actually, the topics weren't all that different - I think we discussed the death penalty (for/against) at least three times. 
However, I suppose these discussions have improved my oral abilities at least a little. 
We did very little grammar in his lessons.  	 
My stay in Brighton also ought to have improved that part of my English. 
I mean, if you are in England you'll certainly have to speak English at least once in a while.  	 
Although my education in English in school haven't been that fantastic, I consider my present skills in the language as pretty good in general. 
My listening and understanding English is good. 
That part of the education in English obviously is a part of everyday life for me, as well as for most people my age. 
Listening to music, watching TV and movies have made it quite easy for me to comprehend English.  	 
I consider my skills in reading English as pretty good as well. 
In "gymnasiet" we read quite a few books in English. 
For one we read 'Kiss, kiss' by Roald Dahl, which I rather enjoyed. 
After my graduation from "gymnasiet" I've tried to keep up my skills in reading English by reading English books once in a while. 
Amongst others I have read On the road by Jack Kerouac, 1984 by George Orwell and The New York Trilogy by Paul Auster.  	 
I'm not really sure about my skilss in writing English. 
I believe I am pretty OK in this area, but I'm not really certain. 
Obviously, I will know when this essay has been handed in.  	 
My great weakness in the English language is my very poor knowledge of grammar. 
By grammar i mean mostly grammar theory - rules and so on. 
This didn't come as a surprise for me when I started this course a few weeks ago. 
I was perfectly aware of my lacking grammar skills and I sure wasn't proved wrong by the diagnostic test we took the first day. 
The sentences and translation parts went along alright, but the concepts part was a disaster.  
Obviously I'll have to work real hard in this part of the course - I already feel I have somewhat improved.  	 
What makes me rather good in English, despite my bad grammars, I believe is my feeling for the language. 
When I'm writing or talking in English I myself think that the result turns out OK. 
I manage most of the time to get the sentences together, so that they're at least understandable, if not grammatically correct. 
Actually I've managed to achieve the highest possible grades in every course I've taken in English since elementary school.  	 
I hope and believe that the A-course in English will improve my skills in all the areas of the language mentioned above.
