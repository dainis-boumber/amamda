 Violence contained in technology - a real problem or not  In our time, violence on TV, video and also computer games is getting more and more excessive. 
Children from an early age stir up fights trying to imitate the stunts they have seen performed. 
What the children do not understand is that the fights they see on film are not real situations, they are stunts, situations tricked by skilfull stuntmen and cameramen. 
What the children instead learn is that you can kick and hit someone in the head ten times and they will still raise.  
Now it can be argued what to do about this. 
Some people argue that the authorities should implement censorship as a solution. 
However, that could be seen as a quite short-sighted and superficial way of dealing with the problem. 
Instead, maybe the solution lies in parental responsibility? 
Or even, the violence expressed by technology is perhaps not the real source to the violence in society. 
It might be something that people focus on just to avoid the real problem. 
If people took their responsibility when it came to childraising in general, the problem with violence much held in new technology would perhaps be solved as simply a consequence. 
Nevertheless, there are aspects that can make the matter of parental responsibility to a rather complicated issue.   
A factor that could be discussed was the change in structure of the family that took place around the time of the II World War. 
Before, the mother used to stay at home and take care of the children. 
Nowadays, both parents in a family are usually working, and it is often found difficult to have enough time for the children. 
TV, video and computer games are often employed as baby-sitters and, commonly, parents have little control over what influences their children get from technology. 
Also, as the children spent much more time at home before, they were mostly influenced by the parents attitudes. 
However, that is no longer the case. 
Now the children, in addition to school, go to kindergarten, and post-school activities. 
The parents skip off their children to the different schoolings and, consciensely or unconsciensely, expect them to be raised there. 
The teachers are often forced to be dealing with childraising rather than teaching. 
However, with the yet bigger classes that is an impossible task. 
Also, the children easily influence each other by showing all the ausame kicks they have picked up somewhere. 
Thus, the children are not being raised in school, the school is rather a growing-ground for violence. 
Accordingly, due to the changed structure of the family, not only have the parents themselves less influence on their children, they also cannot prohibit that the children are influenced by other people in their surroundings.  
Should then women have stayed at home with the children, and the struggle for equality between the sexes be completely wrong? 
Some people might think so, but is not that a very reactionary way of thinking? 
Then there should never be any changes just because another problem might occur. 
Instead, the key to all changes could be that other things should be changed along with them. 
An improvement in the thinking when it comes to having and raising children could be made. 
People nowadays think that they can continue having children like in the old days, and seem to be expecting the children to raise themselves. 
One could wonder when people decide that they want to have children if they should not be willing to spend the time with the children that they need. 
Why would people otherwise want to have children? 
Some seem to believe that they can eat the cake and have it. 
One think they should understand that children are not some kind of cute toys that you can put in the closet when you get tired of them. 
Sacrifieses on the career might be necessary, but, most importantly, they should be made by both parents and not by only one sex. 
Still, if one see it as a sacrifice is it then right to have children?   
To conclude, the problem with violence contained in technology is maybe not a real problem. 
If parents payed more attention to what their children were watching, on for instance TV, maybe advisories warning of violence would be perfectly enough. 
The authorities could instead of just implementing censorship of violence, start dealing with the real source to the problem, and work with changing people's attitudes towards childraising.
