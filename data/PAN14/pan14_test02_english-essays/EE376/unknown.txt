In this essay I will try to evaluate my knowledge in the English language. 
It's my first essay I write in English in a very long time, but I have written many in Swedish during my studies to become a teacher in Swedish and Swedish as a second language. 
I have enjoyed writing essays in Swedish, and I hope it will be just as fun writing in English! 	
I think that the English language sounds very beautifully and poetic and for as long as I remember, the English language has fascinated me.  	
I believe it all started when my four-year-older sister and her friend "played school" and let me join them in their made-up school. 
My sister, who is an English teacher now, played, of course, the teacher then. 
I was the eager pupil who wanted to know as much as she did. 
Naturally I didn't. 
I made a lot of mistakes, but I learned from them and I can proudly say that my English has improved since then. 	
I have been studying and using the English language for quite some time now, but I can't say I feel very competent when it comes to speaking and writing in English. 
However, before I began this English course, I felt rather confident when I spoke English, but after having met the other students, who have been abroad and speak English fluently, my selfesteem almost vanished. 
I guess I have to work twice as hard as my fellow students, but hopefully I will learn twice as much.  	
I feel certain when I speek English with people from other parts than the English speaking world, because we are on the same level. 
The most important thing then, is not to speak correctly when it comes to grammar, but to communicate and try to understand eachother. 
When I speak to an English man, I always think of what to say, and how to say it, rather than concentrate on the communication.  	
I'm not use to write in English. 
For the past five years I have studied to become a teacher in Swedish and in Swedish as a second language and it hasn't been neccessary to write anything in English. 
Neither do I have a penpal to write to in English. 
That's unfortunate, because I have heard that one can develope a good writing skill by correspondence. 
Actually, the main reason why I chose this course, was the possibility to develope my writing skills. 
I think it's a challange to write essays like these and I'm really looking forward to see how my writing will improve. 	
My friends often turn to me when they want to talk and I think I'm a rather good listener, whether the discussion is in Swedish or in English. 
My sister has noticed, and she often points it out, that my vocabulary grows and I know more English words than she does. 
That's probably because I watch more telivision than she does, and I often repeat new words and phrases that I hear. 
Another source is my interest in music, listening as well as singing.  	
When it comes to reading in English, I feel rather secure. 
Most of the literature I read when I studied Swedish as a second language, were in English. 
At first it was quite difficult to read in another language, but I got used to it and now I read without any major problems. 
I also read novels in English, a habit which my sister recommended me.  	
After analysing my skills in English, that is in writing, speaking, listening and reading, I have come to the conclusion that my strengths are listening and reading and my weaknesses are speaking and writing. 
I think it's very good to have done this analyse, because now I know what to focus on and what I need to improve.
