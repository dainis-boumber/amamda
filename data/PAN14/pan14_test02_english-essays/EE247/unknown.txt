 Parents responsibility towards their children are not solved by buying a v-chip.  
Introduction The tube market is growing a lot, and many kids watch the TV each day, and they are of course influenced by it. 
The suggested v-chip (for antiviolence chip) should allow the parents to choose a level of "act of violence" that them allow their children to watch at, and it's good. 
But the parents responsibility towards their children are not solved by v-chips, or through money, and burgers, the kids are worth much more than that. 
They may also have other needs such as more of their parents time, and love. 
As a matter of fact most of the children in the western world are watching the tube many hours each day, and of course they are influenced by what they see, "seeing is believing". 
And it's a problem. 
The tube market growing as well as their offer. 
And to handle the "act of violence" shown on tubes, in a more responsibility way towards the children, would the v-chip solution be good as a starting point. 
Never the less the violence is presented in many ways, and to lock out programs that glorify the violence it's great, but to not admit programs that shows the reality in the society through documentary movies and so on would be bad.  	 
The fact that most of the children in the western world watch the tube many ours each day may have some other reason than that the TV programs are so good. 
It would raise the questing to the adults, why are the children watch the TV so much? 
Do the children suffer in self-esteem, and love, do they yearning after a home who have time for them? 
And if the children suffer in this areas, what answer do then the tube give to their needs? 
It's hard to answer those questing, but we should be aware of it, and think about it. 
To lock out some violence shown on TV through a v-chip for 5 to 30 dollar don't solve the situation, but it can be a toll to it. 	 
The ordinary family structure in the society is destroyed, more than half of the children live their lives without both of their parents. 
The situation is as it is, but it is possible for the society to give more financially help to this families, so they are able to spend more time together. 
It is of course harder to raise a child/ren alone financially, and also compared with a situation their both the mother and father can help each other in bringing up the child/ren.  	 
Many parents go for their career, which make the children sit in between. 
Money for food (Mac Donald's), and cinema tickets... to their children, its a bad substitute for more of their love, and more of their time. 
The parents have a responsibility towards their children, a responsibility to give them of their time, and love. 
Her in Sweden we have the possibility to take maternity- or paternity -leave. 
If we used that opportunity in a better way it also would be a help for many children in many families. 	 
The discussed problem is very big, and it's not possible to mention some tolls that would solve the children's different problems. 
One importune thing is to be aware of the problem, and to think about. 
A higher awareness of the problem in the society, could create a wave that take the problem in a more serious way, and tried to solve it.  
Conclusion The "act of violence" shown on the tube, and watch by kids, are a problem. 
The v-chip (for antiviolence chip), could be a start to the solution of that problem. 
Others tolls to solve the problem could be, financially help from the society to the single parents so this families would be able to spend more time together, as well as a better use of the maternity- or paternity -leave her in Sweden would help many children. 
The Parents have many responsibilities towards their child/ren, and some of this are to give them of their time, and love.
