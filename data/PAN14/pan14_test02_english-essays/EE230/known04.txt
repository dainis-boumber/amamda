 THE V CHIP-A WAY OF REDUCING VIOLENCE  Today films and TV programs are filled with all sorts of violence. 
This is a issue that has been quite often discussed, especially the influence it might have on young people and children in particular. 
There have however not been many suggestions considering how to deal with the problem. 
The article "Locking out violence" is however presenting a solution to the problem; installing a V chip to your TV would actually make it possible to lock the violence out. 
This is I think a very good idea and introducing a V chip is something that should be done as soon as possible.  
Introducing a V chip would reduce violence not only on the TV but in our whole society. 
Several studies have shown that there is a link between watching violent programs and aggressive behaviour. 
A V chip would therefore prevent children from becoming violent as grown ups. 
This would mean that we would get less violent people in our society and we would be protected from becoming assaulted, beaten down or perhaps even raped. 
This would in turn mean less job for the police and less for the social services to do. 
As a consequence, the society would not only get healthier and happier people but would also gain a great deal of money if a V chip was introduced. 
Introducing a V chip would thus give us a less violent society, which is something we all are interested in getting.  
A V chip would also make televisions companies and filmmakers start producing less violent programs and films. 
If people would install V chips in their television sets it would, as previously mentioned, mean that violent programs and films would be locked out. 
This would mean that filmmakers and television companies would lose a lot of viewers if they made movies including a lot of violence. 
As a result, they would be inspired to use less violence in their productions. 
Therefore the introduction of a V chip would result in fewer violent movies and TV productions.  
Some might say that the V chip is a way of introducing some kind of governmental censorship, but this is ridiculous. 
People can them selves chose whether or not to install it, they can themselves decide the degree of violence they want locked out. 
Besides, not having our children in risk of seeing violent episodes on TV and preventing them from all the consequences this have on their well being, should be something obvious. 
Pornography is for example not allowed to be shown during daytime, no one is calling this governmental censorship but rather common sense. 
In the same way, the introduction of a V chip is not a censorship, but plain old common sense.   
The introduction of a V chip would also mean another important advantage, it would ease parents burden and show that protecting our children from violence is not only a family matter but a societal problem as well. 
We can see that it is impossible for parents to deal with this problem themselves and it is important to emphasize that it is not just up to them. 
Take alcohol and smoking for example, of course parents carry a great deal of responsibility in protecting their children from using these substances, but they are also helped and supported by the government in form of a age-limit for buying these things. 
In the same way, a V chip would be a support for parents who impossibly can control all the programs and films their children are watching, especially not today considering the number of channels we have.  
To sum up, a V chip would mean an effective way of protecting our children from all the violence occurring on TV. 
It would reduce violence in our society because less people would become violent and therefore less people would also be assaulted. 
The V chip would also be a trigger for television companies and filmmakers to start making less violent films and programs. 
It would as well ease parents burden, since this after all also is a societal problem not only a family matter. 
Looking at these advantages, there is no reason why a V chip should not be introduced as soon as possible. 
This if something everyone should be interested in; protecting our children, ourselves and in fact our whole society.
