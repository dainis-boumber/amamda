 In this essay I am going to discuss the importance of parental responsibility concerning the violence in television that young children are exposed to. 
There will always be a certain level of violence in television. 
A need for control of the media has developed. 
One potential solution to the problem is gaining support in the United States, according to the article "Locking out violence" by Ginia Bellafante. 
The solution is a computer chip that can be installed in television sets in order to delete TV programs that contain certain levels of violence. 
I think that the use of such an antiviolence chip would be an easy way out of an increasing problem. 
Parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. 
Watching TV becomes an everyday activity for children, and a lot of time is spent on different TV shows, in which a lot of unnecessary violence is included.  
There is something sad about the fact that there actually is a need for an antiviolence chip in many homes. 
Why do so many TV programmes contain so much violence? 
Where is the need for such big amounts of violence in television. 
I cannot see the point in "wallowing" in violence, as I believe a lot of films and series that are broadcasted on television is.  
I believe that it is important for a child to learn the difference between violence that is "make-believe" and violence that is for real. 
I certainly understand parents that want to protect their children from the shock that can come from all kinds of violence on TV, but it is also a need for children to understand that violence in real life actually does exist, and has existed in history, for example anti-Semitism during the second world war. 
It is important for children to grow up knowing that all violence on TV is not make-believe, to understand that bad things can happen, in order to make them want to fight violence in the future. 
My opinion is that the parents have the central role in teaching this. 
They are the ones who have the power to tell their children right from wrong, and to teach them about what is make-believe and what is for real. 
Obviously a lot of violence in action films and series on TV gives the wrong impression to a young child as refers to what the human body is capable of handling. 
A child will no doubt believe that a person actually can take several hard punches to the head and then stand up again, ready to knock out his enemy, when he/she sees it time after time on television. 
The parent are definitely needed to tell the truth about such things.  
I understand the parents that are concerned about the enormous amount of violence in television, and I understand that they want to protect their children from it. 
They think that the antiviolence chip is a potential solution to this problem. 
Unfortunately, I do not believe that they will be able to protect their children this way. 
Violence exists, and it will probably always exist. 
It is around us, almost everywhere, and children are just going to come across it elsewhere. 
The parents are the ones that need to protect their children from violence on television themselves, by spending more time with their children or engage them in some other activities during their time at home.
