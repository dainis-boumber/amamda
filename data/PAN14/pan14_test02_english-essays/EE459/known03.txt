 CHILDREN AND TV VIOLENCE - A PROBLEM  INTRODUCTION In today's society almost every child watches TV. 
It is part of our culture, and the increasing number of hours that children spend in front of the television have led to several researches on whether TV violence is dangerous for children or not. 
So far nothing has been proved. 
Both in <Sweden and in the U S this issue is considered as a big problem. 
The U S is a leading country in many aspects and violence among children is no exception. 
When I read through this article and start to think about the problem I realised that it is a very complex matter and there is no such thing as an easy solution.  
TV VIOLENCE Even though nothing has been proved whether TV violence have an influence on children or not, I think and I know I am not alone, that the violence has an effect on children, in some way or another. 
Almost all children watch TV but everyone of them does not turn into violent criminals. 
In every children's programme there is a small amount of violence, even though it is not for real it still is there. 
Take a Disney film for example or another cartoon. 
How are children going to be able to get a picture of what is right or wrong? 
If we then think of the programmes that are for real, the news for example, the picture gets even more confusing. 
How children react and respond to violence on the television, I believe has to do with their situation at home, at school or in other forms of day care. 
What I mean by that is that it depends on where you live, your "neighbourhood" so to speak. 
It is a big difference between living in Stockholm where you have a much harder attitude than in a smaller place like Vittinge outside Uppsala. 
Even though children get affected of TV violence I do not think that is the only reason why they get violent. 
I see it as a mixture between influences from TV and group pressure and of course the society that the children live in. 
In the article they are talking about the V chip (antiviolence chip), a computer chip that delete any programme with to much violence. 
This might be a beginning to the solution, who knows? 
One thing that I believe has a positive and an important role when it comes to TV violence and children is parental responsibility. 
PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Although parents have to work and cannot always be home they still have a responsibility to know and be interested in what their own children are watching. 
If an adult is not present when the child needs to ask something or have something explained then it can be a problem. 
The child has to rely on its own thoughts and conclusions and that is not always the best alternative. 
I do not think TV is just a bad thing, but as a parent you have to be there, sit in front of the TV with your children and watch. 
It is important to try to see it from the child's perspective. 
Try to see what the little ones are seeing and how they react in different situations. 
One other thing that might be an alternative is to reduce the number of channels. 
As a parent, your time is limited, the thought of just sitting in front of the TV watching children's programmes does not feel like a good idea. 
But maybe it is possible just to let go of everything that you feel has to be done and become a part of children's world. 
Even though the parents take more responsibility the problem what to do when they are not around still remains. 
The V chip, may be a too simple solution to a very complicated problem, at least in the U S. 
A combination between the V chip, parental responsibility and a reduced number of channels might be one of the best solutions at the moment, in the U S, where the problem has reached to a higher level than in Sweden.   
It is hard to come to any conclusions except that the connection between TV violence and children is a problem. 
A problem that is difficult to solve and a problem that affect our society, whether you live in the U S or in Sweden. 
An other issue that I have tried to discuss is parental responsibility. 
I think it is actually more difficult than it seems, but without children of my own, I am perhaps a bit too optimistic, especially of the time. 
But parental responsibility is an important issue and the debate is going to continue years and years from now.
