Abstract

Latent Dirichlet analysis, or topic modeling, is
a exible latent variable framework for model-
ing high-dimensional sparse count data. Various
learning algorithms have been developed in re-
cent years, including collapsed Gibbs sampling,
variational inference, and maximum a posteriori
estimation, and this variety motivates the need
for careful empirical comparisons. In this paper,
we highlight the close connections between these
approaches. We nd that the main differences are
attributable to the amount of smoothing applied
to the counts. When the hyperparameters are op-
timized, the differences in performance among
the algorithms diminish signicantly. The ability
of these algorithms to achieve solutions of com-
parable accuracy gives us the freedom to select
computationally efcient approaches. Using the
insights gained from this comparative study, we
show how accurate topic models can be learned
in several seconds on text corpora with thousands
of documents.

INTRODUCTION

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [Blei et al., 2003] and
Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) [Hofmann,
2001] are well-known latent variable models for high di-
mensional count data, such as text data in the bag-of-
words representation or images represented through fea-
ture counts. Various inference techniques have been pro-
posed, including collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) [Grif-
ths and Steyvers, 2004], variational Bayesian inference
(VB) [Blei et al., 2003], collapsed variational Bayesian in-
ference (CVB) [Teh et al., 2007], maximum likelihood esti-
mation (ML) [Hofmann, 2001], and maximum a posteriori
estimation (MAP) [Chien and Wu, 2008].

Among these algorithms, substantial performance differ-
ences have been observed in practice. For instance, Blei

et al. [2003] have shown that the VB algorithm for LDA
outperforms ML estimation for PLSA. Furthermore, Teh
et al. [2007] have found that CVB is signicantly more ac-
curate than VB. But can these differences in performance
really be attributed to the type of inference algorithm?

In this paper, we provide convincing empirical evidence
that points in a different direction, namely that the claimed
differences can be explained away by the different settings
of two smoothing parameters (or hyperparameters).
In
fact, our empirical results suggest that these inference algo-
rithms have relatively similar predictive performance when
the hyperparameters for each method are selected in an op-
timal fashion. With hindsight, this phenomenon should not
surprise us. Topic models operate in extremely high di-
mensional spaces (with typically more than 10,000 dimen-
sions) and, as a consequence, the curse of dimensionality
is lurking around the corner; thus, hyperparameter settings
have the potential to signicantly affect the results.

We show that the potential perplexity gains by careful
treatment of hyperparameters are on the order of (if not
greater than) the differences between different inference al-
gorithms. These results caution against using generic hy-
perparameter settings when comparing results across algo-
rithms. This in turn raises the question as to whether newly
introduced models and approximate inference algorithms
have real merit, or whether the observed difference in pre-
dictive performance is attributable to suboptimal settings of
hyperparameters for the algorithms being compared.

In performing this study, we discovered that an algorithm
which suggests itself in thinking about inference algo-
rithms in a unied way  but was never proposed by itself
before  performs best, albeit marginally so. More impor-
tantly, it happens to be the most computationally efcient
algorithm as well.

In the following section, we highlight the similarities be-
tween each of the algorithms. We then discuss the impor-
tance of hyperparameter settings. We show accuracy re-
sults, using perplexity and precision/recall metrics, for each
algorithm over various text data sets. We then focus on

INFERENCE TECHNIQUES FOR LDA

2
LDA has roots in earlier statistical decomposition tech-
niques, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [Deer-
wester et al., 1990] and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis (PLSA) [Hofmann, 2001]. Proposed as a generaliza-
tion of PLSA, LDA was cast within the generative Bayesian
framework to avoid some of the overtting issues that were
observed with PLSA [Blei et al., 2003]. A review of the
similarities between LSA, PLSA, LDA, and other models
can be found in Buntine and Jakulin [2006].

We describe the LDA model and begin with general nota-
tion. LDA assumes the standard bag-of-words representa-
tion, where D documents are each represented as a vector
of counts with W components, where W is the number of
words in the vocabulary. Each document j in the corpus is
modeled as a mixture over K topics, and each topic k is a
distribution over the vocabulary of W words. Each topic,
k, is drawn from a Dirichlet with parameter , while each
documents mixture, j, is sampled from a Dirichlet with
parameter 1. For each token i in the corpus, a topic as-
signment zi is sampled from di, and the specic word xi
is drawn from zi. The generative process is below:

k,j  D[]

w,k  D[]

zi  k,di

xi  w,zi.

In Figure 1, the graphical model for LDA is presented in
a slightly unconventional fashion, as a Bayesian network
where kj and wk are conditional probability tables and i
runs over all tokens in the corpus. Each tokens document
index di is explicitly shown as an observed variable, in or-
der to show LDAs correspondence to the PLSA model.

Exact inference (i.e. computing the posterior over the hid-
den variables) for this model is intractable [Blei et al.,
2003], and so a variety of approximate algorithms have
been developed. If we ignore  and  and treat kj and
wk as parameters, we obtain the PLSA model, and max-
imum likelihood (ML) estimation over kj and wk di-
rectly corresponds to PLSAs EM algorithm. Adding the
hyperparameters  and  back in leads to MAP estimation.

1We use symmetric Dirichlet priors for simplicity in this paper.

Treating kj and wk as hidden variables and factorizing
the posterior distribution leads to the VB algorithm, while
collapsing kj and wk (i.e. marginalizing over these vari-
ables) leads to the CVB and CGS algorithms. In the fol-
lowing subsections, we provide details for each approach.

2.1 ML ESTIMATION

The PLSA algorithm described in Hofmann [2001] can be
understood as an expectation maximization algorithm for
the model depicted in Figure 1. We start the derivation by
writing the log-likelihood as,

 = Xi

logXzi

P (xi|zi, ) P (zi|di, )

from which we derive via a standard EM derivation the up-
dates (where we have left out explicit normalizations):

P (zi|xi, di)  P (xi|zi, ) P (zi|di, )

I[xi = w, zi = k]P (zi|xi, di)

w,k  Xi
k,j  Xi

I[zi = k, di = j]P (zi|xi, di) .

(1)

(2)

(3)

These updates can be rewritten by dening wjk = P (z =
k|x = w, d = j), Nwj the number of observations for

word type w in document j, Nwk = Pj Nwjwjk, Nkj =
Pw Nwjwjk, Nk = Pw Nwk and Nj = Pk Nkj,

w,k  Nwk/Nk

k,j  Nkj/Nj .

Plugging these expressions back into the expression for the
posterior (1) we arrive at the update,

wjk 

Nwk Nkj

Nk

(4)

where the constant Nj is absorbed into the normalization.
Hofmann [2001] regularizes the PLSA updates by raising
the right hand side of (4) to a power  > 0 and searching
for the best value of  on a validation set.

2.2 MAP ESTIMATION

We treat ,  as random variables from now on. We add
Dirichlet priors with strengths  for  and  for  respec-
tively. This extension was introduced as latent Dirichlet
allocation in Blei et al. [2003].

It is possible to optimize for the MAP estimate of , .
The derivation is very similar to the ML derivation in the
previous section, except that we now have terms corre-
sponding to the log of the Dirichlet prior which are equal

to Pwk(  1) log wk and Pkj(  1) log kj. After

working through the math, we derive the following update
(de Freitas and Barnard [2001], Chien and Wu [2008]),

wjk 

(Nwk +   1)(Nkj +   1)

(Nk + W   W )

where ,  > 1. Upon convergence, MAP estimates are
obtained:

wk =

Nwk +   1
Nk + W   W

kj =

Nkj +   1
Nj + K  K

.

2.3 VARIATIONAL BAYES

The variational Bayesian approximation (VB) to LDA fol-
lows the standard variational EM framework [Attias, 2000,
Ghahramani and Beal, 2000]. We introduce a factorized
(and hence approximate) variational posterior distribution:

2.4 COLLAPSED VARIATIONAL BAYES

It is possible to marginalize out the random variables kj
and wk from the joint probability distribution. Following
a variational treatment, we can introduce variational pos-
teriors over z variables which is once again assumed to be

factorized: Q(z) = Qi q(zi). This collapsed variational

free energy represents a strictly better bound on the (nega-
tive) evidence than the original VB [Teh et al., 2007]. The
derivation of the update equation for the q(zi) is slightly
more complicated and involves approximations to compute
intractable summations. The update is given below 2:

Q(, , z) = Yk

q(,k)Yj

q(,j)Yi

q(zi) .

ijk 

Using this assumption in the variational formulation of the
EM algorithm [Neal and Hinton, 1998] we readily derive
the VB updates analogous to the ML updates of Eqns. 2, 3
and 1:

q(,k) = D[ + N,k], Nwk = Xi

q(zi = k)(xi, w)

wk + 

N ij
k + W  (cid:16)N ij
N ij

kj + (cid:17) exp(cid:18) 

V ij
kj
2(N ij
kj + )2



V ij
wk
2(N ij
wk + )2

+

V ij
k
2(N ij

k + W )2(cid:19) .

(12)

N ij
kj denotes the expected number of tokens in document
j assigned to topic k (excluding the current token), and can
be calculated as follows: N ij
kj = Pi6=i ijk. For CVB,
there is also a variance associated with each count: V ij
Pi6=i ijk(1  ijk). For further details we refer to Teh

et al. [2007].

kj =

The update in (12) makes use of a second-order Taylor ex-
pansion as an approximation. A further approximation can
be made by using only the zeroth-order information3:

ijk 

wk + 

N ij
k + W  (cid:16)N ij
N ij

kj + (cid:17) .

(13)

We refer to this approximate algorithm as CVB0.

2.5 COLLAPSED GIBBS SAMPLING

MCMC techniques are available to LDA as well.
In
collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) [Grifths and Steyvers,
2004], kj and wk are integrated out (as in CVB) and sam-
pling of the topic assignments is performed sequentially in
the following manner:

P (zij = k|zij, xij = w) 

wk + 

N ij
k + W  (cid:16)N ij
N ij

kj + (cid:17) .

(14)
Nwk denotes the number of word tokens of type w as-
signed to topic k, Nkj is the number of tokens in docu-

ment j assigned to topic k, and Nk = Pw Nwk. N ij

denotes the count with token ij removed. Note that stan-
dard non-collapsed Gibbs sampling over , , and z can
also be performed, but we have observed that CGS mixes
more quickly in practice.

2For convenience, we switch back to the conventional index-

ing scheme for LDA where i runs over tokens in document j.

3The rst-order information becomes zero in this case.

(7)

(8)
(9)

q(,j) = D[ + N,j], Nkj = Xi

q(zi = k)(di, j)

q(zi)  exp(cid:0)E[log xi,zi]q()E[log zi,di]q()(cid:1) .

We can insert the expression for q() at (7) and q() at
(8) into the update for q(z) in (9) and use the fact that

E[logXi]D(X) = (Xi)  (Pj Xj) with () being the

digamma function. As a nal observation, note that there
is nothing in the free energy that would render any differ-
ently the distributions q(zi) for tokens that correspond to
the same word-type w in the same document j. Hence, we
can simplify and update a single prototype of that equiva-
lence class, denoted as wjk , q(zi = k)(xi, w)(di, j)
as follows,

wjk 

exp((Nwk + ))
exp((Nk + W ))

exp(cid:0)(Nkj + )(cid:1) .

(10)

We note that exp((n))  n  0.5 for n > 1. Since Nwk,
Nkj, and Nk are aggregations of expected counts, we ex-
pect many of these counts to be greater than 1. Thus, the
VB update can be approximated as follows,

wjk 

(Nwk +   0.5)

(Nk + W   0.5)(cid:0)Nkj +   0.5(cid:1)

(11)

which exposes the relation to the MAP update in (5).

In closing this section, we mention that the original VB
algorithm derived in Blei et al. [2003] was a hybrid version
between what we call VB and ML here. Although they did
estimate variational posteriors q(), the  were treated as
parameters and were estimated through ML.

2.6 COMPARISON OF ALGORITHMS
A comparison of update equations (5), (11), (12), (13), (14)
reveals the similarities between these algorithms. All of
these updates consist of a product of terms featuring Nwk
and Nkj as well as a denominator featuring Nk. These
updates resemble the Callen equations [Teh et al., 2007],
which the true posterior distribution must satisfy (with Z
as the normalization constant):

P (zij = k|x) = Ep(zij |x)(cid:20) 1

Z

(N ij
(N ij

wk + )

k + W )(cid:0)N ij

kj +(cid:1)(cid:21).

We highlight the striking connections between the algo-
rithms.
Interestingly, the probabilities for CGS (14) and
CVB0 (13) are exactly the same. The only difference is
that CGS samples each topic assignment while CVB0 de-
terministically updates a discrete distribution over topics
for each token. Another way to view this connection is to
imagine that CGS can sample each topic assignment zij
R times using (14) and maintain a distribution over these
samples with which it can update the counts. As R  ,
this distribution will be exactly (13) and this algorithm will
be CVB0. The fact that algorithms like CVB0 are able
to propagate the entire uncertainty in the topic distribution
during each update suggests that deterministic algorithms
should converge more quickly than CGS.

CVB0 and CVB are almost identical as well, the distinction
being the inclusion of second-order information for CVB.

The conditional distributions used in VB (11) and MAP (5)
are also very similar to those used for CGS, with the main
difference being the presence of offsets of up to 0.5 and
1 in the numerator terms for VB and MAP, respectively.
Through the setting of hyperparameters  and , these extra
offsets in the numerator can be eliminated, which suggests
that these algorithms can be made to perform similarly with
appropriate hyperparameter settings.

Another intuition which sheds light on this phenomenon
is as follows. Variational methods like VB are known to
underestimate posterior variance [Wang and Titterington,
2004].
In the case of LDA this is reected in the offset
of -0.5: typical values of  and  in the variational poste-
rior tend to concentrate more mass on the high probability
words and topics respectively. We can counteract this by in-
crementing the hyperparameters by 0.5, which encourages
more probability mass to be smoothed to all words and top-
ics. Similarly, MAP offsets by -1, concentrating even more
mass on high probability words and topics, and requiring
even more smoothing by incrementing  and  by 1.

Other subtle differences between the algorithms exist. For
instance, VB subtracts only 0.5 from the denominator while
MAP removes W , which suggests that VB applies more
smoothing to the denominator. Since Nk is usually large,
we do not expect this difference to play a large role in learn-
ing. For the collapsed algorithms (CGS, CVB), the counts

Nwk, Nkj, Nk are updated after each token update. Mean-
while, the standard formulations of VB and MAP update
these counts only after sweeping through all the tokens.
This update schedule may affect the rate of convergence
[Neal and Hinton, 1998]. Another difference is that the
collapsed algorithms remove the count for the current to-
ken ij.

As we will see in the experimental results section, the per-
formance differences among these algorithms that were ob-
served in previous work can be substantially reduced when
the hyperparameters are optimized for each algorithm.

3 THE ROLE OF HYPERPARAMETERS
The similarities between the update equations for these al-
gorithms shed light on the important role that hyperparame-
ters play. Since the amount of smoothing in the updates dif-
ferentiates the algorithms, it is important to have good hy-
perparameter settings. In previous results [Teh et al., 2007,
Welling et al., 2008b, Mukherjee and Blei, 2009], hyper-
parameters for VB were set to small values like  = 0.1,
 = 0.1, and consequently, the performance of VB was
observed to be signicantly suboptimal in comparison to
CVB and CGS. Since VB effectively adds a discount of up
to 0.5 in the updates, greater values for  and  are nec-
essary for VB to perform well. We discuss hyperparameter
learning and the role of hyperparameters in prediction.

3.1 HYPERPARAMETER LEARNING
It is possible to learn the hyperparameters during training.
One approach is to place Gamma priors on the hyperpa-
rameters (  G[a, b],   G[c, d]) and use Minkas xed-
point iterations [Minka, 2000], e.g.:

 

c  1 + Pj Pk [(Nkj + )  ()]
d + KPj [(Nj + K )  (K )]

.

Other ways for learning hyperparameters include Newton-
Raphson and other xed-point techniques [Wallach, 2008],
as well as sampling techniques [Teh et al., 2006]. Another
approach is to use a validation set and to explore various
settings of ,  through grid search. We explore several of
these approaches later in the paper.

3.2 PREDICTION
Hyperparameters play a role in prediction as well. Consider
the update for MAP in (5) and the estimates for wk and kj
(6) and note that the terms used in learning are the same
as those used in prediction. Essentially the same can be
said for the collapsed algorithms, since the following Rao-
Blackwellized estimates are used, which bear resemblance
to terms in the updates (14), (13):

wk =

Nwk + 
Nk + W 

kj =

Nkj + 
Nj + K

.

(15)

In the case of VB, the expected values of the posterior
Dirichlets in (7) and (8) are used in prediction, leading to

estimates for  and  of the same form as (15). However,
for VB, an offset of 0.5 is found in update equation (10)
while it is not found in the estimates used for prediction.

The knowledge that VBs update equation contains an ef-
fective offset of up to 0.5 suggests the use of an alterna-
tive estimate for prediction:

wk 

exp((Nwk + ))
exp((Nk + W ))

kj 

exp((Nkj + ))
exp((Nj + K))

.

(16)
Note the similarity that these estimates bear to the VB up-
date (10). Essentially, the 0.5 offset is introduced into
these estimates just as they are found in the update. An-
other way to mimic this behavior is to use  + 0.5 and
 + 0.5 during learning and then use  and  for predic-
tion, using the estimates in (15). We nd that correcting
this mismatch between the update and the estimate re-
duces the performance gap between VB and the other al-
gorithms. Perhaps this phenomenon bears relationships to
the observation of Wainwright [2006], who shows that it
certain cases, it is benecial to use the same algorithm for
both learning and prediction, even if that algorithm is ap-
proximate rather than exact.

4 EXPERIMENTS
Seven different text data sets are used to evaluate the perfor-
mance of these algorithms: Craneld-subset (CRAN), Kos
(KOS), Medline-subset (MED), NIPS (NIPS), 20 News-
groups (NEWS), NYT-subset (NYT), and Patent (PAT).
Several of these data sets are available online at the UCI
ML Repository [Asuncion and Newman, 2007]. The char-
acteristics of these data sets are summarized in Table 1.

Each data set is separated into a training set and a test set.
We learn the model on the training set, and then we mea-
sure the performance of the algorithms on the test set. We
also have a separate validation set of the same size as the
test set that can be used to tune the hyperparameters. To
evaluate accuracy, we use perplexity, a widely-used met-
ric in the topic modeling community. While perplexity is a
somewhat indirect measure of predictive performance, it is
nonetheless a useful characterization of the predictive qual-
ity of a language model and has been shown to be well-
correlated with other measures of performance such word-
error rate in speech recognition [Klakow and Peters, 2002].
We also report precision/recall statistics.

Figure 2: Convergence plot showing perplexities on MED,

We describe how perplexity is computed. For each of our
algorithms, we perform runs lasting 500 iterations and we
obtain the estimate wk at the end of each of those runs.
To obtain kj, one must learn the topic assignments on the
rst half of each document in the test set while holding wk
xed. For this fold-in procedure, we use the same learning
algorithm that we used for training. Perplexity is evaluated
on the second half of each document in the test set, given
wk and jk. For CGS, one can average over multiple sam-
ples (where S is the number of samples to average over):

log p(x

test) = Xjw

Njw log

S Xs Xk

wk .

In our experiments we dont perform averaging over sam-
ples for CGS (other than in Figure 7 where we explicitly
investigate averaging), both for computational reasons and
to provide a fair comparison to the other algorithms. Us-
ing a single sample from CGS is consistent with its use as
an efcient stochastic mode-nder to nd a set of inter-
pretable topics for a document set.

For each experiment, we perform three different runs us-
ing different initializations, and report the average of these
perplexities. Usually these perplexities are similar to each
other across different initializations (e.g.  10 or less).

4.1 PERPLEXITY RESULTS
In our rst set of experiments, we investigate the effects of
learning the hyperparameters during training using Minkas
xed point updates. We compare CGS, VB, CVB, and
CVB0 in this set of experiments and leave out MAP since
Minkas update does not apply to MAP. For each run, we
initialize the hyperparameters to  = 0.5,  = 0.5 and turn
on Minkas updates after 15 iterations to prevent numerical
instabilities. Every other iteration, we compute perplexity
on the validation set to allow us to perform early-stopping
if necessary. Figure 2 shows the test perplexity as a func-
tion of iteration for each algorithm on the MED data set.
These perplexity results suggest that CVB and CVB0 out-
perform VB when Minkas updates are used. The reason is
because the learned hyperparameters for VB are too small
and do not correct for the effective 0.5 offset found in the
VB update equations. Also, CGS converges more slowly
than the deterministic algorithms.

In Figure 3, we show the nal perplexities achieved with
hyperparameter learning (through Minkas update), on
each data set. VB performs worse on several of the data
sets compared to the other algorithms. We also found that
CVB0 usually learns the highest level of smoothing, fol-
lowed by CVB, while Minkas updates for VB learn small
values for , .

In our experiments thus far, we xed the number at topics at
K = 40. In Figure 4, we vary the number of topics from 10
to 160. In this experiment, CGS/CVB/CVB0 perform simi-
larly, while VB learns less accurate solutions. Interestingly,
the CVB0 perplexity at K = 160 is higher than the per-
plexity at K = 80. This is due to the fact that a high value
for  was learned for CVB0. When we set  = 0.13 (to
the K = 80 level), the CVB0 perplexity is 1464, matching
CGS. These results suggest that learning hyperparameters
during training (using Minkas updates) does not necessar-
ily lead to the optimal solution in terms of test perplexity.

In the next set of experiments, we use a grid of hyperpa-
rameters for each of  and , [0.01, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
1], and we run the algorithms for each combination of hy-
perparameters. We include MAP in this set of experiments,
and we shift the grid to the right by 1 for MAP (since hyper-
parameters less than 1 cause MAP to have negative proba-
bilities). We perform grid search on the validation set, and

we nd the best hyperparameter settings (according to val-
idation set perplexity) and use the corresponding estimates
for prediction. For VB, we report both the standard per-
plexity calculation and the alternative calculation that was
detailed previously in (16).

In Figure 5, we report the results achieved through perform-
ing grid search. The differences between VB (with the al-
ternative calculation) and CVB have largely vanished. This
is due to the fact that we are using larger values for the
hyperparameters, which allows VB to reach parity with the
other algorithms. The alternative prediction scheme for VB
also helps to reduce the perplexity gap, especially for the
NEWS data set. Interestingly, CVB0 appears to perform
slightly better than the other algorithms.

Figure 6 shows the test perplexity of each method as a
function of .
It is visually apparent that VB and MAP
perform better when their hyperparameter values are off-
set by 0.5 and 1, respectively, relative to the other meth-
ods. While this picture is not as clear-cut for every data set
(since the approximate VB update holds only when n > 1),
we have consistently observed that the minimum perplexi-
ties achieved by VB are at hyperparameter values that are
higher than the ones used by the other algorithms.

In the previous experiments, we used one sample for CGS
to compute perplexity. With enough samples, CGS should
be the most accurate algorithm. In Figure 7, we show the
effects of averaging over 10 different samples for CGS,
taken over 10 different runs, and nd that CGS gains sub-
stantially from averaging samples. It is also possible for
other methods like CVB0 to average over their local poste-
rior modes but we found the resulting gain is not as great.

We also tested whether the algorithms would perform sim-
ilarly in cases where the training set size is very small or
the number of topics is very high. We ran VB and CVB
with grid search on half of CRAN and achieved virtually
the same perplexities. We also ran VB and CVB on CRAN
with K = 100, and only found a 16-point perplexity gap.

To summarize our perplexity results, we juxtapose three
different ways of setting hyperparameters in Figure 8, for
NIPS, K = 40. The rst way is to have the same arbitrary
values used across all algorithms (e.g.  = 0.1,  = 0.1).
The second way is to learn the hyperparameters through
Minkas update. The third way way is to nd the hyperpa-
rameters by grid search. For the third way, we also show
the VB perplexity achieved by the alternative estimates.

4.2 PRECISION/RECALL RESULTS
We also calculated precision/recall statistics on the NEWS
data set. Since each document in NEWS is associated
with one of twenty newsgroups, one can label each doc-
ument by its corresponding newsgroup.
It is possible to
use the topic model for classication and to compute pre-
cision/recall statistics. In Figure 9, we show the mean area
under the ROC curve (AUC) achieved by CGS, VB, CVB,
and CVB0 with hyperparameter learning through Minkas
update. We also performed grid search over ,  and found
that each method was able to achieve similar statistics. For
instance, on NEWS, K = 10, each algorithm achieved the

5 COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY

While the algorithms can give similarly accurate solutions,
some of these algorithms are more efcient than others. VB
contains digamma functions which are computationally ex-
pensive, while CVB requires the maintenance of variance
counts. Meanwhile, the stochastic nature of CGS causes it
to converge more slowly than the deterministic algorithms.

In practice, we advocate using CVB0 since 1) it is faster
than VB/CVB given that there are no calls to digamma or
variance counts to maintain; 2) it converges more quickly
than CGS since it is deterministic; 3) it does not have
MAPs 1 offset issue. Furthermore, our empirical results
suggest that CVB0 learns models that are as good or better
(predictively) than those learned by the other algorithms.

These algorithms can be parallelized over multiple proces-
sors as well. The updates in MAP estimation can be per-
formed in parallel without affecting the xed point since
MAP is an EM algorithm [Neal and Hinton, 1998]. Since
the other algorithms are very closely related to MAP there
is condence that performing parallel updates over tokens
for the other algorithms would lead to good results as well.

While non-collapsed algorithms such as MAP and VB can
be readily parallelized, the collapsed algorithms are se-
quential, and thus there has not been a theoretical basis for
parallelizing CVB or CGS (although good empirical results
have been achieved for approximate parallel CGS [New-
man et al., 2008]). We expect that a version of CVB0 that
parallelizes over tokens would converge to the same quality
of solution as sequential CVB0, since CVB0 is essentially
MAP but without the 1 offset4.

In Table 2, we show timing results for VB, CVB, CGS, and
CVB0 on MED, KOS, and NIPS, with K = 10. We record
the amount of time it takes for each algorithm to pass a
xed perplexity threshold (the same for each algorithm).
Since VB contains many calls to the digamma function,
it is slower than the other algorithms. Meanwhile, CGS
needs more iterations before it can reach the same perplex-
ity, since it is stochastic. We see that CVB0 is computation-
ally the fastest approach among these algorithms. We also
parallelized CVB0 on a machine with 8 cores and nd that
a topic model with coherent topics can be learned in 1.5
seconds for KOS. These results suggest that it is feasible to
learn topic models in near real-time for small corpora.

6 RELATED WORK & CONCLUSIONS
Some of these algorithms have been compared to each
other in previous work. Teh et al. [2007] formulate the
CVB algorithm and empirically compare it to VB, while
Mukherjee and Blei [2009] theoretically analyze the differ-
ences between VB and CVB and give cases for when CVB
should perform better than VB. Welling et al. [2008b] also
compare the algorithms and introduce a hybrid CGS/VB
algorithm. In all these studies, low values of  and  were
used for each algorithm, including VB. Our insights sug-
gest that VB requires more smoothing in order to match
the performance of the other algorithms.

The similarities between PLSA and LDA have been noted
in the past [Girolami and Kaban, 2003]. Others have uni-
ed similar deterministic latent variable models [Welling
et al., 2008a] and matrix factorization techniques [Singh
and Gordon, 2008]. In this work, we highlight the similar-
ities between various learning algorithms for LDA.

While we focused on LDA and PLSA in this paper, we be-
lieve that the insights gained are relevant to learning in gen-

eral directed graphical models with Dirichlet priors, and
generalizing these results to other models is an interesting
avenue to pursue in the future.

In conclusion, we have found that the update equations
for these algorithms are closely connected, and that using
the appropriate hyperparameters causes the performance
differences between these algorithms to largely disappear.
These insights suggest that hyperparameters play a large
role in learning accurate topic models. Our comparative
study also showed that there exist accurate and efcient
learning algorithms for LDA and that these algorithms can
be parallelized, allowing us to learn accurate models over
thousands of documents in a matter of seconds.
