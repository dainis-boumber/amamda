Abstract

While classical kernel-based classiers are
based on a single kernel, in practice it is often
desirable to base classiers on combinations
of multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004)
considered conic combinations of kernel ma-
trices for the support vector machine (SVM),
and showed that the optimization of the co-
ecients of such a combination reduces to
a convex optimization problem known as a
quadratically-constrained quadratic program
(QCQP). Unfortunately, current convex op-
timization toolboxes can solve this problem
only for a small number of kernels and a
small number of data points; moreover, the
sequential minimal optimization (SMO) tech-
niques that are essential in large-scale imple-
mentations of the SVM cannot be applied be-
cause the cost function is non-dierentiable.
We propose a novel dual
formulation of
the QCQP as a second-order cone program-
ming problem, and show how to exploit the
technique of Moreau-Yosida regularization to
yield a formulation to which SMO techniques
can be applied. We present experimental re-
sults that show that our SMO-based algo-
rithm is signicantly more ecient than the
general-purpose interior point methods avail-
able in current optimization toolboxes.

1. Introduction

One of the major reasons for the rise to prominence
of the support vector machine (SVM) is its ability to
cast nonlinear classication as a convex optimization
problem, in particular a quadratic program (QP). Con-

vexity implies that the solution is unique and brings a
suite of standard numerical software to bear in nding
the solution. Convexity alone, however, does not imply
that the available algorithms scale well to problems of
interest. Indeed, o-the-shelf algorithms do not suce
in large-scale applications of the SVM, and a second
major reason for the rise to prominence of the SVM
is the development of special-purpose algorithms for
solving the QP (Platt, 1998; Joachims, 1998; Keerthi
et al., 2001).

Recent developments in the literature on the SVM
and other kernel methods have emphasized the need
to consider multiple kernels, or parameterizations of
kernels, and not a single xed kernel. This provides
needed exibility and also reects the fact that prac-
tical learning problems often involve multiple, hetero-
geneous data sources. While this so-called multiple
kernel learning problem can in principle be solved via
cross-validation, several recent papers have focused on
more ecient methods for kernel learning (Chapelle
et al., 2002; Grandvalet & Canu, 2003; Lanckriet et al.,
2004; Ong et al., 2003). In this paper we focus on the
framework proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004), which
involves joint optimization of the coecients in a conic
combination of kernel matrices and the coecients of
a discriminative classier.
In the SVM setting, this
problem turns out to again be a convex optimization
problema quadratically-constrained quadratic pro-
gram (QCQP). This problem is more challenging than
a QP, but it can also be solved in principle by general-
purpose optimization toolboxes such as Mosek (Ander-
sen & Andersen, 2000). Again, however, this existing
algorithmic solution suces only for small problems
(small numbers of kernels and data points), and im-
proved algorithmic solutions akin to sequential mini-
mization optimization (SMO) are needed.

While the multiple kernel learning problem is convex,
it is also non-smoothit can be cast as the minimiza-
tion of a non-dierentiable function subject to linear

constraints (see Section 3.1). Unfortunately, as is well
known in the non-smooth optimization literature, this
means that simple local descent algorithms such as
SMO may fail to converge or may converge to incor-
rect values (Bertsekas, 1995). Indeed, in preliminary
attempts to solve the QCQP using SMO we ran into
exactly these convergence problems.

One class of solutions to non-smooth optimization
problems involves constructing a smooth approximate
problem out of a non-smooth problem.
In particu-
lar, Moreau-Yosida (MY) regularization is an eec-
tive general solution methodology that is based on
inf-convolution (Lemarechal & Sagastizabal, 1997). It
can be viewed in terms of the dual problem as simply
adding a quadratic regularization term to the dual ob-
jective function. Unfortunately, in our setting, this
creates a new dicultywe lose the sparsity that
makes the SVM amenable to SMO optimization. In
particular, the QCQP formulation of Lanckriet et al.
(2004) does not lead to an MY-regularized problem
that can be solved eciently by SMO techniques.

In this paper we show how these problems can be re-
solved by considering a novel dual formulation of the
QCQP as a second-order cone programming (SOCP)
problem. This new formulation is of interest on its
own merit, because of various connections to existing
algorithms. In particular, it is closely related to the
classical maximum margin formulation of the SVM,
diering only by the choice of the norm of the in-
verse margin. Moreover, the KKT conditions arising
in the new formulation not only lead to support vec-
tors as in the classical SVM, but also to a dual notion
of support kernelsthose kernels that are active in
the conic combination. We thus refer to the new for-
mulation as the support kernel machine (SKM).

As we will show, the conic dual problem dening the
SKM is exactly the multiple kernel learning problem
of Lanckriet et al. (2004).1 Moreover, given this new
formulation, we can design a Moreau-Yosida regular-
ization which preserves the sparse SVM structure, and
therefore we can apply SMO techniques.

Making this circle of ideas precise requires a number
of tools from convex analysis. In particular, Section 3
denes appropriate approximate optimality conditions
for the SKM in terms of subdierentials and approxi-
mate subdierentials. These conditions are then used
in Section 4 in the design of an MY regularization for
the SKM and an SMO-based algorithm. We present

the results of numerical experiments with the new
method in Section 5.

2. Learning the kernel matrix

In this section, we (1) begin with a brief review
of the multiple kernel learning problem of Lanckriet
et al.
(2004), (2) introduce the support kernel ma-
chine (SKM), and (3) show that the dual of the SKM
is equivalent to the multiple kernel learning primal.

2.1. Multiple kernel learning problem

In the multiple kernel learning problem, we assume
that we are given n data points (xi, yi), where xi  X
for some input space X , and where yi  {1, 1}. We
also assume that we are given m matrices Kj  Rnn,
which are assumed to be symmetric positive semidef-
inite (and might or might not be obtained from eval-
uating a kernel function on the data {xi}). We con-
sider the problem of learning the best linear combi-
nation Pm

tive coecients j > 0 and with a trace constraint

ers for the constraints >D(y)KjD(y) 6

2.2. Support kernel machine

We now introduce a novel classication algorithm that
we refer to as the support kernel machine (SKM).
It will be motivated as a block-based variant of the
SVM and related margin-based classication algo-
rithms. But our underlying motivation is the fact that
the dual of the SKM is exactly the problem (L). We
establish this equivalence in the following section.

2.2.1. Linear classification

In this section we let X = Rk. We also assume we are
given a decomposition of Rk as a product of m blocks:
Rk = Rk1    Rkm, so that each data point xi can
be decomposed into m block components, i.e. xi =
(x1i, . . . , xmi), where each xji is in general a vector.

The goal

is to nd a linear classier of the form

y = sign(w>x + b) where w has the same block de-
composition w = (w1, . . . , wm)  Rk1++km. In the
spirit of the soft margin SVM, we achieve this by min-
imizing a linear combination of the inverse of the mar-
gin and the training error. Various norms can be used
to combine the two terms, and indeed many dierent
algorithms have been explored for various combina-
tions of `1-norms and `2-norms.
In this paper, our
goal is to encourage the sparsity of the vector w at
the level of blocks; in particular, we want most of its
(multivariate) components wi to be zero. A natural
way to achieve this is to penalize the `1-norm of w.
Since w is dened by blocks, we minimize the square
of a weighted block `1-norm, (Pm
j=1 dj||wj||2)2, where
within every block, an `2-norm is used. Note that a
standard `2-based SVM is obtained if we minimize the
square of a block `2-norm, Pm
2, which corre-
sponds to ||w||2
2, i.e., ignoring the block structure. On
the other hand, if m = k and dj = 1, we minimize the
square of the `1-norm of w, which is very similar to
the LP-SVM proposed by Bradley and Mangasarian
(1998). The primal problem for the SKM is thus:

j=1 ||wj||2

2.2.2. Conic duality and optimality

conditions

For a given optimization problem there are many ways
of deriving a dual problem.
In our particular case,
we treat problem (P ) as a second-order cone program
(SOCP) (Lobo et al., 1998), which yields the following
dual (see Appendix A for the derivation):

min 1

2 2  >e

(D) w.r.t.   R,   Rn

s.t. 0 6  6 C, >y = 0

||Pi iyixji||2 6 dj, j  {1, . . . , m}.
In addition, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal-
ity conditions give the following complementary slack-
ness equations:

j xji + b)  1 + i) = 0, i

(a) i(yi(Pj w>
(b) (C  i)i = 0, i
||wj ||2(cid:1)>(cid:0) P i iyixji
(c) (cid:0) wj
(d) (P djtj  ) = 0.

dj 

(cid:1) = 0, j

Equations (a) and (b) are the same as in the classi-
cal SVM, where they dene the notion of a support
vector. That is, at the optimum, we can divide the

data points into three disjoint sets: I0 = {i, i = 0},
IM = {i, i  (0, C)}, and IC = {i, i = C}, such that
points belonging to I0 are correctly classied points
not on the margin and such that i = 0; points in
IM are correctly classied points on the margin such
that i = 0 and yi(Pj w>
j xji + b) = 1, and points
in IC are points on the wrong side of the margin
for which i > 0 (incorrectly classied if i > 1) and
yi(Pj w>
j xji + b) = 1  i. The points whose indices i
are in IM or IC are the support vectors.

While the KKT conditions (a) and (b) refer to the in-
dex i over data points, the KKT conditions (c) and (d)
refer to the index j over components of the input vec-
tor. These conditions thus imply a form of sparsity not
over data points but over input dimensions. Indeed,
two non-zero elements (u, v) and (u0, v0) of a second-
order cone Kd = {(u, v)  Rd  R, ||u||2 6 v} are or-
thogonal if and only if they both belong to the bound-
ary, and they are anti-proportional (Lobo et al.,
||u0||2 =
1998); that is,  > 0 such that ||u||2 = v,
v0, (u, v) = (u0, v0) (see Figure 1).
Thus, if  > 0, we have:
 if ||Pi iyixji||2 < dj, then wj = 0,
 if ||Pi iyixji||2 = dj, then j > 0, such that
wj = j Pi iyixji, ||wj||2 = jdj.
Sparsity thus emerges from the optimization prob-
lem. Let J denote the set of active dimensions, i.e.,
J (, ) = {j : ||Pi iyixji||2 = dj}. We can rewrite
the optimality conditions as

j, wj = j Pi iyixji, with j = 0 if j / J .

Equation (d) implies that  = Pj dj||wj||2 =
Pj dj(jdj), which in turn implies PjJ d2
j j = 1.

2.2.3. Kernelization

We now remove the assumption that X is a Euclidean
space, and consider embeddings of the data points xi
in a Euclidean space via a mapping  : X  Rf . In
correspondence with our block-based formulation of

the classication problem, we assume that (x) has m
distinct block components (x) = (1(x), . . . , m(x)).
Following the usual recipe for kernel methods, we as-
sume that this embedding is performed implicitly, by
specifying the inner product in Rf using a kernel func-
tion, which in this case is the sum of individual kernel
functions on each block component:

k(xi, xj) = (xi)>(xj) = Pm

s=1 s(xi)>s(xj)

= Pm

s=1 ks(xi, xj).

We now kernelize the problem (P ) using this ker-
nel function.
In particular, we consider the dual of
(P ) and substitute the kernel function for the inner
products in (D):

min 1

2 2  e>

(DK ) w.r.t.   R,   Rn

s.t. 0 6  6 C, >y = 0

(>D(y)KjD(y))1/2 6 dj,j,

where Kj is the j-th Gram matrix of the points {xi}
corresponding to the j-th kernel.

The sparsity that emerges via the KKT conditions (c)
and (d) now refers to the kernels Kj, and we refer
to the kernels with nonzero j as support kernels.
The resulting classier has the same form as the SVM
classier, but is based on the kernel matrix combina-
tion K = Pj jKj, which is a sparse combination of
support kernels.

2.3. Equivalence of the two formulations
By simply taking dj = q tr Kj
, we see that problem
(DK) and (L) are indeed equivalentthus the dual of
the SKM is the multiple kernel learning primal. Care
must be taken here thoughthe weights j are dened
for (L) as Lagrange multipliers and for (DK) through
the anti-proportionality of orthogonal elements of a
second-order cone, and a priori they might not coin-
cide: although (DK) and (L) are equivalent, their dual
problems have dierent formulations. It is straightfor-
ward, however, to write the KKT optimality condi-
tions for (, ) for both problems and verify that they
are indeed equivalent. One direct consequence is that
for an optimal pair (, ),  is an optimal solution of
the SVM with kernel matrix Pj jKj.

3. Optimality conditions

In this section, we formulate our problem (in either
of its two equivalent forms) as the minimization of
a non-dierentiable convex function subject to linear

constraints. Exact and approximate optimality condi-
tions are then readily derived using subdierentials. In
later sections we will show how these conditions lead
to an MY-regularized algorithmic formulation that will
be amenable to SMO techniques.

3.1. Max-function formulation

A rearrangement of the problem (DK) yields an equiv-
alent formulation in which the quadratic constraints
are moved into the objective function:

min max

j n 1
(S) w.r.t.   Rn

s.t. 0 6  6 C, >y = 0.

>D(y)KjD(y)  >eo

>D(y)KjD(y)  >e and
We let Jj() denote
J() = maxj Jj(). Problem (S) is the minimization
of the non-dierentiable convex function J() subject
to linear constraints. Let J () be the set of active
kernels, i.e., the set of indices j such that Jj() =
J(). We let Fj()  Rn denote the gradient of Jj,
that is, Fj = Jj

D(y)KjD(y)  e.

3.2. Optimality conditions and subdierential

Given any function J(), the subdierential of J at 
J() is dened as (Bertsekas, 1995):
J() = {g  Rn, 0, J(0) > J() + g>(0  )}.
Elements of the subdierential J() are called sub-
gradients. When J is convex and dierentiable at ,
then the subdierential is a singleton and reduces to
the gradient. The notion of subdierential is especially
useful for characterizing optimality conditions of non-
smooth problems (Bertsekas, 1995).

The function J() dened in the earlier section is a
pointwise maximum of convex dierentiable functions,
and using subgradient calculus we can easily see that
the subdierential J() of J at  is equal to the
convex hull of the gradients Fj of Jj for the active
kernels. That is:

J() = convex hull{Fj(), j  J ()}.

The Lagrangian for (S) is equal to L() = J() 
> + >( Ce) + b>y, where b  R, ,   Rn
+, and
the global minimum of L(, , , b) with respect to 
is characterized by the equation

0  L()      by  J().

The optimality conditions are thus the following:
, (b, , ) is a pair of optimal primal/dual variables

if and only if:

(OP T0)

    by  J()
i, ii = 0, i(C  i) = 0
>y = 0, 0 6  6 C.

As before, we dene IM () = {i, 0 < i < C},
I0() = {i, i = 0}, IC() = {i, i = C}. We also de-
ne, following (Keerthi et al., 2001), I0+ = I0{i, yi =
1} and I0 = I0 {i, yi = 1}, IC+ = IC {i, yi = 1},
IC = IC  {i, yi = 1}. We can then rewrite the
optimality conditions as

(OP T1)

j j = 1

  be = D(y)PjJ () d2

i  IM  I0+  IC, i > 0
i  IM  I0+  IC, i 6 0.

3.3. Approximate optimality conditions

such as

Exact optimality conditions
(OP T0) or
(OP T1) are generally not suitable for numerical op-
timization.
In non-smooth optimization theory, one
instead formulates optimality criteria in terms of the
-subdierential, which is dened as
J() = {g  Rn,0, J(0) > J()+g>(0)}.
When J() = maxj Jj(), then the -subdierential
contains (potentially strictly) the convex hull of the
gradients Fj(), for all -active functions, i.e., for all
j such that maxi Ji()   6 Jj(). We let J()
denote the set of all such kernels. So, we have C() =
convex hull{Fj(), j  J()}  J().

Note that for one kernel,
i.e., when the SKM re-
duces to the SVM, this corresponds to the approxi-
mate KKT conditions usually employed for the stan-
dard SVM (Platt, 1998; Keerthi et al., 2001; Joachims,
1998). For a given , checking optimality is hard, since
even computing 1J() is hard in closed form. How-
ever, a sucient condition for optimality can be ob-
tained by using the inner approximation C1() of this

1-subdierential, i.e., the convex hull of gradients of
1-active kernels. Checking this sucient condition
is a linear programming (LP) existence problem, i.e.,
nd  such that:

iIM I0+IC{(K()D(y))i  yi} + 22,
where K() = PjJ1 () jKj. Given , we can de-
termine whether it is (1, 2)-optimal by solving the
potentially large LP (OP T3). If in addition to having
, we know a potential candidate for , then a suf-
cient condition for optimality is that this  veries
(OP T3), which doesnt require solving the LP. Indeed,
the iterative algorithm that we present in Section 4
outputs a pair (, ) and only these sucient optimal-
ity conditions need to be checked.

3.4. Improving sparsity

Once we have an approximate solution, i.e., values 
and  that satisfy (OP T3), we can ask whether  can
be made sparser.
Indeed, if some of the kernels are
close to identical, then some of the s can potentially
be removedfor a general SVM, the optimal  is not
unique if data points coincide, and for a general SKM,
the optimal  and  are not unique if data points or
kernels coincide. When searching for the minimum
`0-norm  which satises the constraints (OP T3), we
can thus consider a simple heuristic approach where
we loop through all the nonzero j and check whether
each such component can be removed. That is, for all
j  J1 (), we force j to zero and solve the LP. If it
is feasible, then the j-th kernel can be removed.

4. Regularized support kernel machine

The function J() is convex but not dierentiable.
It is well known that in this situation, steepest de-
scent and coordinate descent methods do not necessar-
ily converge to the global optimum (Bertsekas, 1995).
SMO unfortunately falls into this class of methods.
Therefore, in order to develop an SMO-like algorithm
for the SKM, we make use of Moreau-Yosida regu-
larization.
In our specic case, this simply involves
adding a second regularization term to the objective
function of the SKM, as follows:
2 (Pj dj||wj||2)2 + 1

2 Pj a2
(R) w.r.t. w  Rk1    Rkm ,   Rn

s.t. yi(Pj w>

where (aj) are the MY-regularization parameters.

4.1. Dual problem

(j dj )2

G() = minR+,Rm{ 1

||Pi iyixji||2 6 j,j},
then the dual problem is equivalent to minimizing
G() subject to 0 6  6 C and >y = 0. We
prove in Appendix B that G() is dierentiable and
we show how to compute G() and its derivative in
time O(m log m).

4.2. Solving the MY-regularized SKM using

SMO

Since the objective function G() is dierentiable, we
can now safely envisage an SMO-like approach, which
consists in a sequence of local optimizations over only
two components of . Since the -optimality con-
ditions for the MY-regularized SKM are exactly the
same as for the SVM, but with a dierent objective
function (Platt, 1998; Keerthi et al., 2001):

(OP T4)

max

iIM I0IC+{yiG()i}

6

min

iIM I0+IC{yiG()i} + 2,

choosing the pair of indices can be done in a manner
similar to that proposed for the SVM, by using the fast
heuristics of Platt (1998) and Keerthi et al. (2001). In
addition, caching and shrinking techniques (Joachims,
1998) that prevent redundant computations of kernel
matrix values can also be employed.

A dierence between our setting and the SVM set-
ting is the line search, which cannot be performed in
closed form for the MY-regularized SKM. However,
since each line search is the minimization of a con-
vex function, we can use ecient one-dimensional root
nding, such as Brents method (Brent, 1973).

4.3. Theoretical bounds

In order to be able to check eciently the approxi-
mate optimality condition (OP T3) of Section 3.3, we
need estimates for  and  from the solution of the

MY-regularized SKM obtained by SMO. It turns out
that the KKT conditions for the MY-regularized SKM
also lead to support kernels, i.e., there is a sparse non-
negative weight vector  such that  is a solution of
the SVM with the kernel K = Pj jKj. However, in
the regularized case, those weights  can be obtained
directly from  as a byproduct of the computation of
G() and its derivative. Those weights () do not
satisfy Pj d2
j j = 1, but can be used to dene weights
() that do (we give expressions for () and () in
Appendix B).

Let 1, 2 be the two tolerances for the approximate
optimality conditions for the SKM. In this section,
we show that if (aj) are small enough, then an 2/2-
optimal solution of the MY-regularized SKM , to-
gether with (), is an (1, 2)-optimal solution of the
SKM, and an a priori bound on (aj) is obtained that
does not depend on the solution .

Theorem 1 Let 0 <  < 1. Let y  {1, 1}n and Kj,
j = 1, . . . , m be m positive semidenite kernel matri-
ces. Let dj and aj, j = 1, . . . , m, be 2m strictly posi-
tive numbers. If  is an -optimal solution of the MY-
regularized SKM, then (, ()) is an (1, 2)-optimal
solution of the SKM, with

4.4. A minimization algorithm

We solve the SKM by solving the MY-regularized SKM
with decreasing values of the regularization parameters
(aj).
In our simulations, the kernel matrices are all
normalized, i.e., have unit diagonal, so we can choose
all dj equal. We use aj() =  and dj() = (1  ),
where  is a constant in [0, 1]. When  = 1, the MY-
regularized SKM is exactly the SVM based on the sum
of the kernels, while when  = 0, it is the non-MY-
regularized SKM.

The algorithm is as follows: given the data and pre-
cision parameters 1, 2, we start with  = 1, which

solves the SVM up to precision 2/2 using standard
SMO, and then update  to  (where  < 1) and
solve the MY-regularized SKM with constant  using
the adjusted SMO up to precision 2/2, and so on. At
the end of every SMO optimization, we can extract
weights j() from the  solution, as shown in Ap-
pendix B, and check the (1, 2)-optimality conditions
(OP T3) of the original problem (without solving the
LP). Once they are satised, the algorithm stops.

Since each SMO optimization is performed on a
dierentiable function with Lipschitz gradient and
SMO is equivalent to steepest descent for the `1-
norm (Joachims, 1998), classical optimization results
show that each of those SMO optimizations is nitely
convergent (Bertsekas, 1995). Corollary 1 directly im-
plies there are only a nite number of such optimiza-
tions; thus, the overall algorithm is nitely convergent.

Additional speed-ups can be easily achieved here. For
example, if for successive values of , some kernels have
a zero weight, we might as well remove them from the
algorithm and check after convergence if they can be
safely kept out. In simulations, we use the following
values for the free parameters:  = 0.5, 1/n = 0.0005,
2 = 0.0001, where the value for 1/n corresponds to
the average value this quantity attains when solving
the QCQP (L) directly using Mosek.

5. Simulations

We compare the algorithm presented in Section 4.4
with solving the QCQP (L) using Mosek for two
datasets, ionosphere and breast cancer, from the UCI
repository, and nested subsets of the adult dataset
from Platt (1998). The basis kernels are Gaussian
kernels on random subsets of features, with varying
widths. We vary the number of kernels m for xed
number of data points n, and vice versa. We report
running time results (Athlon MP 2000+ processor,
2.5G RAM) in Figure 2. Empirically, we obtain an
average scaling of m1.1 and n1.4 for the SMO-based
approach and m1.6 and n4.1 for Mosek. Thus the al-
gorithm presented in this paper appears to provide a
signicant improvement over Mosek in computational
complexity, both in terms of the number of kernels and
the number of data points.

6. Conclusion

We have presented an algorithm for ecient learning
of kernels for the support vector machine. Our al-
gorithm is based on applying sequential minimization
techniques to a smoothed version of a convex non-
smooth optimization problem. The good scaling with

respect to the number of data points makes it pos-
sible to learn kernels for large scale problems, while
the good scaling with respect to the number of basis
kernels opens up the possibility of application to large-
scale feature selection, in which the algorithm selects
kernels that dene non-linear mappings on subsets of
input features.

Appendix A. Dual of the SKM

The primal problem (P) can be put in the following
equivalent form, where Kk = {(u, v)  Rk+1,||u||2 6
v} is the second-order cone of order k (we now omit the
summation intervals, with the convention that index i
goes from 1 to n and index j goes from 1 to m):

j xji + b) > 1  i, i

The cone Kk is self-dual, so the conic Lagrangian cor-

After computing derivatives with respect to the pri-
mal variables and setting them to zero, we readily get
the dual function: g(, , , , ) =  1

of dummy variables, we obtain problem (D).

Appendix B. Computation of G()
Let j() = 1
over each i; a short calculation reveals:

dj ||Pi iyixji||2. We can rst maximize

where (x, y) = max(0,x  y)2. The function 
is continuously dierentiable, with partial derivatives
y (cid:17) = (1  y/x, 2y  2x) if y 6 x,
equal to (cid:16) 
and zero otherwise. Also, for given x, it is a piecewise
quadratic function of y. We thus need to minimize a
piecewise quadratic dierentiable strictly convex func-
tion of , which can be done easily by inspecting all
points of non-dierentiability, which requires sorting
the sequence (j). The complexity of such an algo-
rithm is O(m log m).

Because of strict convexity the minimum with respect
to  is unique and denoted ().
In addition, this
uniqueness implies that G() is dierentiable and that
its derivative is equal to:

and can be used to check optimality. Corollary 1
shows that if (aj) is small enough, then if  is ap-
proximately optimal for the MY-regularized SKM, the
pair (, ()) is approximately optimal for the SKM.
