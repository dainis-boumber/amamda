1. INTRODUCTION

Boosting has been a very successful technique for solving
the two-class classication problem. It was rst introduced
by [8], with their AdaBoost algorithm. In going from two-
class to multi-class classication, most boosting algorithms
have been restricted to reducing the multi-class classica-
tion problem to multiple two-class problems, e.g. [8], [19],
and [21]. The ways to extend AdaBoost from two-class to
multi-class depend on the interpretation or view of the suc-
cess of AdaBoost in binary classication, which still remains
controversial. Much theoretical work on AdaBoost has been
based on the margin analysis, for example, see [20] and [13].
Another view on boosting, which is popular in the statistical
community, regards AdaBoost as a functional gradient de-
scent algorithm [6, 11, 17]. In [11], AdaBoost has been shown
to be equivalent to a forward stagewise additive modeling al-
gorithm that minimizes the exponential loss. [11] suggested
that the success of AdaBoost can be understood by the fact

that the population minimizer of exponential loss is one-
half of the log-odds. Based on this statistical explanation,
[11] derived a multi-class logit-boost algorithm.

The multi-class boosting algorithm by [11] looks very dif-
ferent from AdaBoost, hence it is not clear if the statis-
tical view of AdaBoost still works in the multi-class case.
To resolve this issue, we think it is desirable to derive an
AdaBoost-like multi-class boosting algorithm by using the
exact same statistical explanation of AdaBoost. In this pa-
per, we develop a new algorithm that directly extends the
AdaBoost algorithm to the multi-class case without reduc-
ing it to multiple two-class problems. Surprisingly, the new
algorithm is almost identical to AdaBoost but with a sim-
ple yet critical modication, and similar to AdaBoost in
the two-class case, this new algorithm combines weak clas-
siers and only requires the performance of each weak clas-
sier be better than random guessing. We show that the
proposed multi-class AdaBoost algorithm is equivalent to a
forward stagewise additive modeling algorithm that mini-
mizes a novel exponential loss for multi-class classication.
Furthermore, we show that the exponential loss is a mem-
ber of a class of Fisher-consistent loss functions for multi-
class classication. Combined with forward stagewise addi-
tive modeling, these loss functions can be used to derive
various multi-class boosting algorithms. We believe this pa-
per complements [11].

1.1 AdaBoost
Before delving into the new algorithm for multi-class
boosting, we briey review the multi-class classication
problem and the AdaBoost algorithm [8]. Suppose we are
given a set of training data (x1, c1), . . . , (xn, cn), where the
input (prediction variable) xi  Rp, and the output (re-
sponse variable) ci is qualitative and assumes values in a
nite set, e.g. {1, 2, . . . , K}. K is the number of classes. Usu-
ally it is assumed that the training data are independently
and identically distributed samples from an unknown prob-
ability distribution Prob(X, C). The goal is to nd a classi-
cation rule C(x) from the training data, so that when given a
new input x, we can assign it a class label c from {1, . . . , K}.
(cid:4)
Under the 0/1 loss, the misclassication error rate of a classi-

er C(x) is given by 1(cid:2)

(cid:3)

It is clear that


C

Prob(C = k|X = x)

will minimize this quantity with the misclassication error
rate equal to 1  EX maxk Prob(C = k|X). This classier is

known as the Bayes classier, and its error rate is the Bayes
error rate.

The AdaBoost algorithm is an iterative procedure that
(x) by combining
tries to approximate the Bayes classier C
many weak classiers. Starting with the unweighted train-
ing sample, the AdaBoost builds a classier, for example a
classication tree [5], that produces class labels. If a training
data point is misclassied, the weight of that training data
point is increased (boosted). A second classier is built us-
ing the new weights, which are no longer equal. Again, mis-
classied training data have their weights boosted and the
procedure is repeated. Typically, one may build 500 or 1000
classiers this way. A score is assigned to each classier, and
the nal classier is dened as the linear combination of the
classiers from each stage. Specically, let T (x) denote a
weak multi-class classier that assigns a class label to x,
then the AdaBoost algorithm proceeds as follows:

When applied to two-class classication problems, Ad-
aBoost has been proved to be extremely successful in pro-
ducing accurate classiers. In fact, [1] called AdaBoost with
trees the best o-the-shelf classier in the world. How-
ever, it is not the case for multi-class problems, although
AdaBoost was also proposed to be used in the multi-class
case [8]. Note that the theory of [8] assumes that the error
of each weak classier err(m) is less than 1/2 (or equiva-
lently (m) > 0), with respect to the distribution on which

350 J. Zhu et al.

it was trained. This assumption is easily satised for two-
class classication problems, because the error rate of ran-
dom guessing is 1/2. However, it is much harder to achieve
in the multi-class case, where the random guessing error rate
is (K  1)/K. As pointed out by the inventors of AdaBoost,
the main disadvantage of AdaBoost is that it is unable to
handle weak learners with an error rate greater than 1/2. As
a result, AdaBoost may easily fail in the multi-class case. To
illustrate this point, we consider a simple three-class simu-
lation example. Each input x  R10, and the ten input vari-
ables for all training examples are randomly drawn from
a ten-dimensional standard normal distribution. The three
classes are dened as:

tion, so as to put approximately equal numbers of observa-
tions in each class. In short, the decision boundaries separat-
ing successive classes are nested concentric ten-dimensional
spheres. The training sample size is 3000 with approximately
1000 training observations in each class. An independently
drawn test set of 10000 observations is used to estimate the
error rate.

Figure 1 (upper row) shows how AdaBoost breaks using
ten-terminal node trees as weak classiers. As we can see
(upper left panel), the test error of AdaBoost actually starts
to increase after a few iterations, then levels o around 0.53.
What has happened can be understood from the upper mid-
dle and upper right panels: the err(m) starts below 0.5; after
a few iterations, it overshoots 0.5 ((m) < 0), then quickly
hinges onto 0.5. Once err(m) is equal to 0.5, the weights of
the training samples do not get updated ((m) = 0), hence
the same weak classier is tted over and over again but is
not added to the existing t, and the test error rate stays
the same.

This illustrative example may help explain why Ad-
aBoost is never used for multi-class problems. Instead, for
multi-class classication problems, [21] proposed the Ad-
aBoost.MH algorithm which combines AdaBoost and the
one-versus-all strategy. There are also several other multi-
class extensions of the boosting idea, for example, the ECOC
in [19] and the logit-boost in [11].

1.2 Multi-class AdaBoost

We introduce a new multi-class generalization of Ad-
aBoost for multi-class classication. We refer to our algo-
rithm as SAMME  Stagewise Additive Modeling using a
Multi-class Exponential loss function  this choice of name
will be clear in Section 2. Given the same setup as that of
AdaBoost, SAMME proceeds as follows:

Figure 1. Comparison of AdaBoost and the new algorithm SAMME on a simple three-class simulation example. The training
sample size is 3000, and the testing sample size is 10000. Ten-terminal node trees are used as weak classiers. The upper row

Note that Algorithm 2 (SAMME) shares the same simple
modular structure of AdaBoost with a simple but subtle dif-
ference in (1), specically, the extra term log(K  1). Obvi-
ously, when K = 2, SAMME reduces to AdaBoost. However,
the term log(K  1) in (1) is critical in the multi-class case
(K > 2). One immediate consequence is that now in order

Multi-class AdaBoost 351

for (m) to be positive, we only need (1 err(m)) > 1/K, or
the accuracy of each weak classier to be better than ran-
dom guessing rather than 1/2. To appreciate its eect, we
apply SAMME to the illustrative example in Section 1.1. As
can be seen from Fig. 1, the test error of SAMME quickly
decreases to a low value and keeps decreasing even after 600
iterations, which is exactly what we could expect from a
successful boosting algorithm. In Section 2, we shall show
that the term log(K 1) is not articial, it follows naturally
from the multi-class generalization of the exponential loss
in the binary case.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec-
tion 2, we give theoretical justication for our new algo-
rithm SAMME. In Section 3, we present numerical results
on both simulation and real-world data. Summary and dis-
cussion regarding the implications of the new algorithm are
in Section 4.

2. STATISTICAL JUSTIFICATION

In this section, we are going to show that the extra term
log(K  1) in (1) is not articial; it makes Algorithm 2
equivalent to tting a forward stagewise additive model us-
ing a multi-class exponential loss function. Our arguments
are in line with [11] who developed a statistical perspective
on the original two-class AdaBoost algorithm, viewing the
two-class AdaBoost algorithm as forward stagewise additive
modeling using the exponential loss function

L(y, f) = e

yf ,

where y = (I(c = 1)  I(c = 2))  {1, 1} in a two-class
classication setting. A key argument is to show that the
population minimizer of this exponential loss function is one
half of the logit transform

f (x)

Prob(c = 1|x)
Prob(c = 2|x) .

Therefore, the Bayes optimal classication rule agrees with
(x). [11] recast AdaBoost as a functional gra-
the sign of f
(x). We note that
dient descent algorithm to approximate f
besides [11], [2] and [21] also made connections between the
original two-class AdaBoost algorithm and the exponential
loss function. We acknowledge that these views have been
inuential in our thinking for this paper.

2.1 SAMME as forward stagewise additive

modeling

We now show that Algorithm 2 is equivalent to forward
stagewise additive modeling using a multi-class exponential
loss function.
We start with the forward stagewise additive modeling
using a general loss function L(,), then apply it to the

352 J. Zhu et al.

multi-class exponential loss function. In the multi-class clas-
sication setting, we can recode the output c with a K-
dimensional vector y, with all entries equal to  1
K1 except
a 1 in position k if c = k, i.e. y = (y1, . . . , yK)T, and:

[14] and [16] used the same coding for the multi-class sup-
port vector machine. Given the training data, we wish to
nd f(x) = (f1(x), . . . , fK(x))T such that

We consider f(x) that has the following form:
M(cid:5)

f(x) =

m=1

where (m)  R are coecients, and g(m)(x) are basis func-
tions. We require g(x) to satisfy the symmetric constraint:

g1(x) +  + gK(x) = 0.

For example, the g(x) that we consider in this paper takes
value in one of the K possible K-dimensional vectors in (2);
specically, at a given x, g(x) maps x onto Y:

g : x  Rp  Y,

where Y is the set containing K K-dimensional vectors:

Forward stagewise modeling approximates the solution
to (3)(4) by sequentially adding new basis functions to the
expansion without adjusting the parameters and coecients
of those that have already been added. Specically, the al-
gorithm starts with f (0)(x) = 0, sequentially selecting new
basis functions from a dictionary and adding them to the
current t:

2.2 The multi-class exponential loss

We now justify the use of the multi-class exponential
loss (6). Firstly, we note that when K = 2, the sum-to-
zero constraint indicates f = (f1,f1) and then the multi-
class exponential loss reduces to the exponential loss used
in binary classication. [11] justied the exponential loss by
showing that its population minimizer is equivalent to the
Bayes rule. We follow the same arguments to investigate
what is the population minimizer of this multi-class expo-
nential loss function. Specically, we are interested in

2.3 Fisher-consistent multi-class loss

functions

We have shown that the population minimizer of the new
multi-class exponential loss is equivalent to the multi-class
Bayes rule. This property is shared by many other multi-
class loss functions. Let us use the same notation as in Sec-
tion 2.1, and consider a general multi-class loss function

L(y, f) =

Therefore, the multi-class Fisher-consistent condition basi-
cally says that with innite samples, one can exactly recover
the multi-class Bayes rule by minimizing the multi-class loss
using (). Thus our denition of Fisher-consistent losses is
a multi-class generalization of the binary Fisher-consistent
loss function discussed in [15].

In the following theorem, we show that there are a class
of convex functions that are Fisher-consistent for K-class
classication, for all K  2.
Theorem 1. Let (t) be a non-negative twice dierentiable
(cid:3)(cid:3)(t) > 0 for t, then  is Fisher-
function. If

let f be the solution of (18), then we have

Theorem 1 immediately concludes that the three most
popular smooth loss functions, namely, exponential, logit
and L2 loss functions, are Fisher-consistent for all multi-
class classication problems regardless the number of
classes. The inversion formula (21) allows one to easily con-
struct estimates for the conditional class probabilities. Ta-
ble 1 shows the explicit inversion formulae for computing the
conditional class probabilities using the exponential, logit
and L2 losses.

With these multi-class Fisher-consistent losses on hand,
we can use the forward stagewise modeling strategy to de-
rive various multi-class boosting algorithms by minimizing
the empirical multi-class loss. The biggest advantage of the
exponential loss is that it gives us a simple re-weighting for-
mula. Other multi-class loss functions may not lead to such
a simple closed-form re-weighting scheme. One could han-
dle this computation issue by employing the computational

trick used in [10] and [6]. For example, [24] derived a multi-
class boosting algorithm using the logit loss. A multi-class
version of the L2 boosting can be derived following the lines
in [6]. We do not explore these directions in the current pa-
per. To x ideas, we shall focus on the multi-class AdaBoost
algorithm.

3. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we use both simulation data and real-
world data to demonstrate our multi-class AdaBoost algo-
rithm. For comparison, a single decision tree (CART; [5])
and AdaBoost.MH [21] are also t. We have chosen to com-
pare with the AdaBoost.MH algorithm because it is concep-
tually easy to understand and it seems to have dominated
other proposals in empirical studies [21]. Indeed, [22] also
argue that with large samples, AdaBoost.MH has the op-
timal classication performance. The AdaBoost.MH algo-
rithm converts the K-class problem into that of estimating
a two-class classier on a training set K times as large, with
an additional feature dened by the set of class labels. It is
essentially the same as the one vs. rest scheme [11].

We would like to emphasize that the purpose of our nu-
merical experiments is not to argue that SAMME is the ul-
timate multi-class classication tool, but rather to illustrate
that it is a sensible algorithm, and that it is the natural ex-
tension of the AdaBoost algorithm to the multi-class case.

3.1 Simulation
We mimic a popular simulation example found in [5]. This
is a three-class problem with twenty one variables, and it is
considered to be a dicult pattern recognition problem with
Bayes error equal to 0.140. The predictors are dened by


 u  v1(j) + (1  u)  v2(j) + j, Class 1,
u  v1(j) + (1  u)  v3(j) + j, Class 2,
u  v2(j) + (1  u)  v3(j) + j, Class 3,

(22)

xj =

where j = 1, . . . , 21, u is uniform on (0, 1), j are standard
normal variables, and the v(cid:4) are the shifted triangular wave-
forms: v1(j) = max(6  |j  11|, 0), v2(j) = v1(j  4) and
v3(j) = v1(j + 4).

The training sample size is 300 so that approximately 100
training observations are in each class. We use the classi-
cation tree as the weak classier for SAMME. The trees are
built using a greedy, top-down recursive partitioning strat-
egy, and we restrict all trees within each method to have the

same number of terminal nodes. This number is chosen via
ve-fold cross-validation. We use an independent test sam-
ple of size 5000 to estimate the error rate. Averaged results
over ten such independently drawn training-test set combi-
nations are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2.

As we can see, for this particular simulation example,
SAMME performs slightly better than the AdaBoost.MH al-
gorithm. A paired t-test across the ten independent compar-
isons indicates a signicant dierence with p-value around
0.003.

3.2 Real data
In this section, we show the results of running SAMME on
a collection of datasets from the UC-Irvine machine learn-
ing archive [18]. Seven datasets were used: Letter, Nursery,
Pendigits, Satimage, Segmentation, Thyroid and Vowel.
These datasets come with pre-specied training and testing
sets, and are summarized in Table 3. They cover a wide
range of scenarios: the number of classes ranges from 3
to 26, and the size of the training data ranges from 210
to 16,000 data points. The types of input variables in-
clude both numerical and categorical, for example, in the
Nursery dataset, all input variables are categorical vari-
ables. We used a classication tree as the weak classier
in each case. Again, the trees were built using a greedy,
top-down recursive partitioning strategy. We restricted all
trees within each method to have the same number of ter-
minal nodes, and this number was chosen via ve-fold cross-
validation.

Figure 3 compares SAMME and AdaBoost.MH. The test
error rates are summarized in Table 5. The standard er-
te.err  (1  te.err)/n.te, where
rors are approximated by
te.err is the test error, and n.te is the size of the testing
data.

The most interesting result is on the Vowel dataset. This
is a dicult classication problem, and the best methods
achieve around 40% errors on the test data [12]. The data
was collected by [7], who recorded examples of the eleven
steady state vowels of English spoken by fteen speakers for
a speaker normalization study. The International Phonetic
Association (IPA) symbols that represent the vowels and the
words in which the eleven vowel sounds were recorded are
given in Table 4.

Four male and four female speakers were used to train
the classier, and then another four male and three fe-
male speakers were used for testing the performance. Each

gave 528 frames from the eight speakers used as the train-
ing data and 462 frames from the seven speakers used as
the testing data. Ten predictors are derived from the digi-
tized speech in a rather complicated way, but standard in
the speech recognition world. As we can see from Fig. 3 and
Table 5, for this particular dataset, the SAMME algorithm

performs almost 15% better than the AdaBoost.MH algo-
rithm.

For other datasets, the SAMME algorithm performs
slightly better
than the AdaBoost.MH algorithm on
Letter, Pendigits, and Thyroid, while slightly worse on
Segmentation. In the Segmentation data, there are only
210 training data points, so the dierence might be just
due to randomness. It is also worth noting that for the
Nursery data, both the SAMME algorithm and the Ad-
aBoost.MH algorithm are able to reduce the test error
to zero, while a single decision tree has about 0.8% test
error rate. Overall, we are comfortable to say that the
performance of SAMME is comparable with that of the
AdaBoost.MH.

For the purpose of further investigation, we also merged
the training and the test sets, and randomly split them into
new training and testing sets. The procedure was repeated
ten times. Again, the performance of SAMME is comparable
with that of the AdaBoost.MH. For the sake of space, we do
not present these results.

4. DISCUSSION

The statistical view of boosting, as illustrated in [11],
shows that the two-class AdaBoost builds an additive model
to approximate the two-class Bayes rule. Following the same
statistical principle, we have derived SAMME, the natural
and clean multi-class extension of the two-class AdaBoost
algorithm, and we have shown that

 SAMME adaptively implements the multi-class Bayes
rule by tting a forward stagewise additive model for
multi-class problems;
 SAMME follows closely to the philosophy of boosting,
i.e. adaptively combining weak classiers (rather than
regressors as in logit-boost [11] and MART [10]) into a
powerful one;
 At each stage, SAMME returns only one weighted clas-

sier (rather than K), and the weak classier only needs
to be better than K-class random guessing;
 SAMME shares the same simple modular structure of

AdaBoost.

Our numerical experiments have indicated that Ad-
aBoost.MH in general performs very well and SAMMEs
performance is comparable with that of the AdaBoost.MH,
and sometimes slightly better. However, we would like to
emphasize that our goal is not to argue that SAMME is
the ultimate multi-class classication tool, but rather to il-
lustrate that it is the natural extension of the AdaBoost
algorithm to the multi-class case. The success of SAMME
is used here to demonstrate the usefulness of the forward
stagewise modeling view of boosting.

[11] called the AdaBoost algorithm Discrete AdaBoost
and proposed Real AdaBoost and Gentle AdaBoost algo-
rithms which combine regressors to estimate the conditional
class probability. Using their language, SAMME is also a dis-
crete multi-class AdaBoost. We have also derived the corre-
sponding Real Multi-class AdaBoost and Gentle Multi-class

358 J. Zhu et al.

AdaBoost [23, 24]. These results further demonstrate the
usefulness of the forward stagewise modeling view of boost-
ing.

It should also be emphasized here that although our sta-
tistical view of boosting leads to interesting and useful re-
sults, we do not argue it is the ultimate explanation of boost-
ing. Why boosting works is still an open question. Interested
readers are referred to the discussions on [11]. [9] mentioned
that the forward stagewise modeling view of AdaBoost does
not oer a bound on the generalization error as in the orig-
inal AdaBoost paper [8]. [3] also pointed out that the sta-
tistical view of boosting does not explain why AdaBoost is
robust against overtting. Later, his understandings of Ad-
aBoost lead to the invention of random forests [4].

Finally, we discuss the computational cost of SAMME.
Suppose one uses a classication tree as the weak learner,
and the depth of each tree is xed as d, then the computa-
tional cost for building each tree is O(dpn log(n)), where p
is the dimension of the input x. The computational cost for
our SAMME algorithm is then O(dpn log(n)M) since there
are M iterations.

The SAMME algorithm has been implemented in the R
computing environment, and will be publicly available from
the authors websites.
