Introduction

Over the last decade ongoing development of statistical mod-
elling tools (e.g., Hastie et al., 2001) has led to a growing
sophistication in the methods used to analyse relationships
between the distributions of species and their environment
(e.g., Guisan and Zimmermann, 2000). Such analyses are now
widely used in terrestrial (e.g., Pereira and Itami, 1991; Ferrier
et al., 2002), freshwater (e.g., Lek et al., 1996; Olden and
Jackson, 2001) and marine settings (e.g., Ysebaert et al., 2002),
motivated by purposes ranging from the testing of ecologi-

cal hypotheses (e.g., Austin, 2002) or processes (Leathwick and
Austin, 2001) to the prediction of species distributions across
geographically extensive areas for conservation (e.g., Gregr
and Trites, 2001; Elith and Burgman, 2002) and/or resource
management (e.g., Borchers et al., 1997). While earlier tech-
niques such as generalized linear models (GLMMcCullagh
and Nelder, 1989) were found to be limited in their ability
to t the complex, non-linear relationships often occurring
between species and environmental predictors (e.g., Austin et
al., 1990), a range of techniques are now available that allow
their more realistic description. Of these, generalized additive

models (GAMHastie and Tibshirani, 1990) are perhaps the
most widely used, particularly in terrestrial (e.g., Leathwick,
1998) and marine studies (e.g., Gregr and Trites, 2001). How-
ever, although their use of non-parametric smoothing func-
tions allows exible description of complex species responses
to environment (Yee and Mitchell, 1991), their computational
complexity makes cumbersome the generation of predictions
for independent datasets such as in a geographic information
system (GIS).

Two other commonly used techniques capable of tting
non-linear relationships between species and environment
are neural nets (Ripley, 1996) and classication and regression
trees (Breiman et al., 1984). Of these, neural nets are prone
to become computationally intractable with larger datasets
(e.g., Moisen and Frescino, 2002; Friedman and Meulman,
2003), while misclassication can be problematic with clas-
sication and regression trees unless they are used in con-
junction with boosting algorithms (Friedman and Meulman,
2003). A third alternative, multivariate adaptive regression
splines (MARSFriedman, 1991), has shown promise in recent
comparative studies (Moisen and Frescino, 2002; Mu noz and
Fellicsimo, 2004). This technique combines the strengths of
regression trees and spline tting by replacing the step func-
tions normally associated with regression trees with piecewise
linear basis functions (see Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990, Chap-
ter 9). This allows the modelling of complex relationships
between a response variable and its predictors. In practical
terms, MARS has exceptional analytical speed, and its simple
rule-based basis functions facilitate the prediction of species
distributions using independent data (Mu noz and Fellicsimo,
2004), stored, for example, in a GIS.

In this study we compare the performance of GAM and
MARS analyses of an extensive set of data describing the
distributions of 15 sh species in New Zealand rivers and
streams. While our past experience has mostly involved use
of GAMs (e.g., Elith and Burgman, 2002; Leathwick and Austin,
2001), our increasing use of extensive databases has some-
times resulted in very slow model tting, and at times we
have been unable to t GAM models to full datasets because of
memory limitations imposed by the numerical complexities of
this technique. This prompted our exploration of alternative
methods capable of realistically analysing ecological data. A
comprehensive description of the ecological insights derived
from the MARS component of this analysis is contained in
Leathwick et al. (2005).

Distributional data

Both the species distribution data and the associated envi-
ronmental data used in this study are described compre-
hensively by Leathwick et al. (2005) and only a brief sum-
mary is provided here. Fish distribution data comprised
capture records from 9866 sites, extracted from the New
Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (McDowall and Richardson,
1983; http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/nzffd/). As records of
sh abundances were available for only a subset of sites, all
data were converted to a common basis (presenceabsence)

for this analysis. Data describe the distributions of 15 diadro-
mous species (Table 1), species that move between freshwater
and marine habitats in completing their life cycles (McDowall,
1999). All species occurred in the dataset with a capture fre-
quency of 0.5% or above, i.e., had a minimum of nearly 50 pos-
itive occurrences. Sixteen environmental predictors (Table 2)
were selected for their functional relevance to the physiolog-
ical and behavioural attributes of diadromous species. These
include factors describing the character of the river segment
within which the sampling site was located, downstream fac-
tors affecting the ability of diadromous sh to migrate from
the sea to that river segment, and upstream/catchment-scale
factors affecting environmental conditions at the sampling
site. As regression methods are potentially sensitive to cor-
related variables, the nal set of candidate variables was
restricted to those with pairwise correlations of less than 0.7,
with one variable normalised to reduce its correlation with
other variables.

Model tting

2.2.1. Generalized additive models
Initially, we attempted to t generalized additive models in
S-Plus (v. 6.1, Insightful Corporation, Seattle) using a start-
ing model that included all predictor variables as smooth
terms, and which was then simplied as required using a back-
wards/forwards stepwise procedure to remove terms making
a non-signicant contribution. However, this procedure was
not only very slow, but we were also unable to compare the
statistical signicance of tting predictors as linear versus
smooth terms because of the excessive memory demands
with a dataset of this size. Similar problems were also encoun-
tered when this analysis was attempted using the gam pack-
age in R (R Development Core Team, 2004).

As an alternative strategy, we used BRUTO (available in
the mda library for both S-Plus and R and documented by
Hastie and Tibshirani, 1996), which ts a generalized addi-
tive model using an adaptive back-tting procedure (Hastie
and Tibshirani, 1990). In addition to identifying which vari-
ables to include in the nal GAM model, BRUTO identies the

optimal degree of smoothing for each variable. BRUTO also
allows specication of a penalty parameter that is applied to
the addition of extra variables in the model, and we used 10-
fold cross-validation to verify that the default value of 2 for
the penalty parameter was appropriate for our data (Hastie
et al., 2001). However, because BRUTO can only be used to t
models assuming Gaussian errors, model parameters describ-
ing the selected variables and their degree of smoothing were
extracted and used to specify a model of identical form but
allowing for binomial errors. This was then tted using the
standard GAM function (gam). Comparison of full backwards
stepwise GAM models and BRUTO/GAM models for all species
using k-fold cross-validation (e.g., Hastie et al., 2001) indi-
cated that, while the full GAM models were better tted to
the training data, the BRUTO/GAM models delivered superior
performance for independent sites. In addition, because the
BRUTO/GAM models could be tted in only 12% of the time
taken for the full backwards GAM models, we were able to
assess their performance more rigorously using the computa-
tionally intensive re-sampling techniques described below.

2.2.2. Multivariate adaptive regression splines
All MARS models were tted in R using code available in the
same mda library used for tting the BRUTO/GAM models.
We also evaluated the closely similar polymars, available in
the polspline library for R, but found this to be much slower. It
also differs in some key respects from the original formulation
of MARS.

MARS is a procedure for tting adaptive non-linear regres-
sion that uses piecewise basis functions to dene relation-
ships between a response variable and some set of predictors
(Friedman, 1991). Basis functions are dened in pairs, using

a knot or value of a variable that denes an inection point
along the range of a predictor, e.g.,

bfn = max(0, 1.0  SegFlow) and
bfn+1 = max(0, SegFlow  1.0).

In this example the knot takes a value of 1, and the values of
bfn can therefore be seen to have a value of 1 when SegFlow is 0,
declining to 0 as SegFlow approaches 1. Values remain xed at
0 at values of SegFlow greater than 1. By contrast, bfn+1 (the pair
to bfn) takes a value of SegFlow 1 when SegFlow is greater
than 1, but otherwise takes a value of 0. Within the model,
coefcients applied to each of the basis functions dene the
slopes of the non-zero sections. Use of a single basis func-
tion allows the tting of a non-zero slope within part of the
range of a predictor variable (Fig. 1a), while the tting of two
basis functions for a predictor variable in a linear regression
allows specication of different slopes within different parts
of its range (Fig. 1b). More than one knot (i.e., more than one
pair of basis functions) can be specied for a predictor vari-
able, allowing complex non-linear relationships to be tted.
Alternatively, the basis functions can be envisaged as a new
predictor matrix, in which one or more columns that are basis
functions replace each predictor variable in the original data.
When tting a MARS model, knots are chosen automat-
ically in a forward stepwise manner (Hastie and Tibshirani,
1996). Candidate knots can be placed at any position within
the range of each predictor variable to dene a pair of basis
functions. At each step, the model selects the knot and its
corresponding pair of basis functions that give the great-
est decrease in the residual sum of squares. Knot selection

proceeds until some maximum model size is reached, after
which a backwards-pruning procedure is applied in which
those basis functions that contribute least to model t are pro-
gressively removed. At this stage, a predictor variable can be
dropped from the model completely if none of its basis func-
tions contribute meaningfully to predictive performance. The
sequence of models generated from this process is then eval-
uated using generalized cross-validation, and the model with
the best predictive t is selected.

Two novel features are possible when using MARS. First,
interactions between variables can be tted, but rather than
tting a global interaction between a pair of variables, these
are specied using basis functions. As each basis function only
describes variation for part of the range of its variable, interac-
tions are specied locally, i.e., the interaction effect is conned
to the sub-ranges of the two variables described by the non-
zero parts of the basis functions, rather than across the full
range of both variables. The R implementation of MARS also
allows for the tting of multiple response variables, which
allows a model to be tted that simultaneously relates vari-
ation in the occurrence of all species to the environmental
predictors in one analysis. In this case knots are selected based
on their ability to reduce the residual sum of squares, averaged
across all species. The nal MARS model then uses a common
set of basis functions for all response variables, but individual
regressions are used to relate variation in each species to the
nal set of basis functions (i.e., to calculate unique coefcients
for each basis function per species).

The current implementation of MARS in R uses least
squares tting appropriate for data with normally distributed
errors. With binomial data this frequently results in the range
of tted values being erroneously expanded beyond their nor-
mal 01 range, e.g., from 0.2 to 1.2 or more. Rather than sim-
ply truncating these values, we used the procedure described
by Friedman (1991) in which he proposes use of a GLM to con-
strain them within the correct range for presenceabsence
data. This was achieved by tting a MARS model using the
standard R code, extracting the basis functions from the MARS
model, and computing a GLM that related these to the pres-
ence/absence of each species. Four sets of MARS models were
tted for this comparative analysis, i.e., two sets of 15 indi-

vidual species models, one tted without interactions and the
second tted with rst order interactions. Two multiresponse
models were then tted, one without interactions and one
with rst order interactions.

2.3.

Model evaluation

Comparison of the performance of the ve sets of statistical
models, i.e., individual GAM models, and individual and mul-
tiresponse MARS models tted with and without interactions,
was carried out using both the change in residual deviance
as in conventional logistic regression, and the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROCe.g., Fielding
and Bell, 1997). The latter indicates the ability of a model to
discriminate between sites where a species is present versus
those where it is absent. A score of 0.5 indicates that a model
has no discriminatory ability, while a score of 1 indicates
that presences and absences are perfectly discriminated. ROC
areas were calculated for each of the models by evaluating the
performance of a model against the species occurrence data
used to dene it (referred to as ROCtrain). However, as these
estimates are likely to be overly optimistic about model per-
formance, we also used the 632+ bootstrap method (ROCboot)
to estimate model performance when predictions are made to
independent data (Efron and Tibshirani, 1997). Bootstrapping
gives similar results to a cross-validation, but is less prone to
bias (Steyerberg et al., 2001).

actions explained the greatest amounts of deviance, while
the multiresponse model tted with interactions explained

intermediate amounts of deviance. GAM models included the
highest number of predictor variables (Table 3), and both the
non-interaction and interaction MARS multiresponse models
used more predictors than the average number used by the
corresponding MARS individual models.

Average marginal changes in deviance when dropping indi-
vidual predictors from the various nal models (Table 4) sug-
gest that a relatively small set of predictors plays a dominant
role in explaining variation in the probability of capture for
most diadromous sh species. These include correlates or
drivers of key functional aspects of stream character, includ-
ing accessibility from the sea (DSDist), summer temperature
(SegJanT), stream size (SegFlow) and catchment-scale drivers
of variation in stream hydrology, particularly those affecting
variability in water ow (USSlope and USRainDays).

ROC areas calculated for the various models using their
training data (ROCtrain in Table 3; Appendix A) suggest that the
GAM models marginally outperform both the individual MARS
models and the MARS multiresponse model unless the MARS

models are tted with interactions. However, when the same
statistic is calculated using bootstrap simulation to assess
performance when predicting to independent data, standard
errors on the adjusted ROC scores (ROCboot in Table 3) indi-
cate that the practical signicance of any differences between
the ve sets of models is minimal. Comparison of ROC boot-
strap scores from the non-interaction MARS individual and
MARS multiresponse models indicates that the latter on aver-
age gives marginally better discrimination, particularly for
species of lower prevalence (Fig. 2), such as Galpos and Rhoret
(Appendix A).

Inspection of the response functions tted by the MARS
individual and multiresponse models indicates that the piece-
wise MARS functions generally approximated closely the more
continuous curves tted by the GAM models (Fig. 3). Most
differences occurred in parts of the range of variables rep-
resented by few data points, and/or where there were wide
standard errors about the GAM curves. Complex, non-linear
responses were tted for most species for a number of vari-

models

These results provide important insights into both the relative
strengths of two readily available modelling methods, and the
need for robust methods for assessing model performance.
The value of using models capable of tting non-linear rela-
tionships between species occurrence or abundance and envi-
ronment identied in other studies (e.g., Moisen and Frescino,
2002; Olden and Jackson, 2002; Mu noz and Fellicsimo, 2004;
Moisen et al., this issue) is emphasized again here by the fre-
quency with which complex non-linear responses were tted
in our analyses. Many of these tted responses were asym-
metrical or skewed, and would therefore be difcult to t with
conventional parametric models. While we focus on the tech-
nical aspects of the modelling here, we have investigated the
ecological relationships in detail elsewhere and are satised
that they are sensible and provide insight into the ecology of
these sh (Leathwick et al., 2005).

Comparison of GAM and MARS models conrms that the
piecewise tting of linear segments by the latter captures
much of the information described by the more sophisti-
cated scatter-plot smooth functions used in GAMs. Although

ticularly strong sorting of species. One variable (USAvgTNorm)
was omitted from the analysis after it was tted with overly
complex curves with very high standard errors in a large pro-
portion of the GAM models. Computation speed was similar
for the BRUTO/GAM and MARS individual models, both tting
in around 1% of the time taken to t a full backwards step-

types of MARS models and the more numerically complex
GAM models was somewhat surprising, it is consistent with
results from several other recent comparative studies (e.g.,
Elith, 2002; Moisen and Frescino, 2002; Mu noz and Fellicsimo,
2004). Together, these suggest that a number of non-linear
techniques offer similar levels of performance for modelling
species distributions, leaving questions of choice of technique
to be inuenced more by other considerations such as com-
putational speed, ability to ignore predictors of marginal rele-
vance, transparency of tted relationships and the ease with
which model results can be incorporated into other analyses.
While the superior speed of MARS had already been noted
in other ecological studies (e.g., Moisen and Frescino, 2002),
the computational efciency of BRUTO when used as a tool to
specify a GAM model was a more novel result. Although this
algorithm has been available for approximately 15 years, we
are not aware of its use in any ecological studies. Its speed
results largely from its use of an adaptive back-tting proce-
dure similar to that used in MARS to guide both the selection
of variables and to identify their optimal degree of smooth-
ing. In addition, varying the penalty parameter used to specify
model complexity using cross-validation to assess model per-
formance on independent data allows a ready means to iden-
tify the most parsimonious model. In terms of speed, both
these approaches clearly offer considerable advantages (2
orders of magnitude) over more conventional stepwise tting
of GAMs, and are also likely to be considerably faster than
other computationally intensive techniques that can become
intractable with larger datasets (Moisen and Frescino, 2002).
Both techniques readily allow inspection of the responses t-
ted between a species and its predictors to enable their con-
sistency with ecological knowledge to be assessed (Austin,
2002; Austin et al., this issue). In addition, our experience con-
rms that the computationally more simple basis functions
tted by MARS offer advantages over GAM models when model
results are used for subsequent prediction as in a GIS (Mu noz
and Fellicsimo, 2004). Finally, the problems caused by our
GAM models tting overly complex curves, and which resulted
in the omission of one variable from the analysis, were not
encountered when that variable was included in models t-
ted with MARS.

The biggest disadvantage we identify in the immediate use
of BRUTO and MARS for ecological modelling is that their
current implementations are tted assuming normally dis-
tributed errors, so they need to be coupled with a GAM or GLM
model, respectively, to properly analyse presence/absence or
count data, a procedure described for MARS by Friedman
(1991). In both cases, this was achieved readily through the
development of relatively simple scripts in R. Some caution
may be required when the automated model selection proce-
dure is used to specify degrees of freedom (BRUTO) or select
knots (MARS) for correlated pairs of variables. Where two such
variables are tted with markedly different degrees of free-
dom, both the complexity of the responses that are tted, and
their relative contributions to the model outcome may vary
depending on the order in which they are tted. In practice,
this means that care must be taken with choice of predic-
tor variables, and preference given to variables that are not
strongly correlated to others in the set. Predictions will still
be reasonable if made to regions where the predictor vari-

ables have a similar correlation structure, but may be more
problematic if predictions are made for new sites where these
correlations change (Austin, 2002).

4.2.

Robust model evaluation

The importance of robust model evaluation is clearly evident
when the ROC area statistics we computed using the training
data are compared with those from the more rigorous boot-
strapping that assesses model performance when predictions
are made for new data. For example, ROC area statistics com-
puted using training data indicated that the GAM models pro-
vided better discrimination than either the individual MARS
models or the MARS multiresponse model. However, results
from the more robust bootstrap assessments indicate minimal
difference in model discrimination, and instead suggest that
there is a strong tendency for both the GAM and interaction
MARS models to over-t the data. That is, they have adapted to
idiosyncrasies that, while occurring in the training data, had
little relevance to an independent set of evaluation data. This
issue is discussed further in Edwards et al. (this issue). k-Fold
cross validation provides an alternative approach to model
evaluation, and might be more feasible with some computa-
tionally demanding modelling approaches such as stepwise
GAMs. However, its estimates of error rates with independent
data are likely to be less precise than those derived from boot-
strapping, which can be thought of as a smoothed version of
cross-validation (Efron and Tibshirani, 1997). Other examples
of the use of the bootstrap in evaluating modelled predic-
tions can be found in Wintle et al. (2005) and Thomson et al.
(2005).

4.3.

Simultaneous modelling of species

Finally, we were surprised by the strong performance of the
multiresponse MARS model, and this result has potentially
major implications for the practicalities of analysing large
datasets describing the distributions of numerous species. Our
initial concern was that the distributions of species of low
prevalence might be poorly analysed by such a model, because
their specic relationships with environment would be sub-
merged by information from more widespread species. How-
ever, ROC area scores for predictions of low prevalence species
from the MARS multiresponse model were consistently higher
than for equivalent scores from the MARS individual mod-
els. We interpret this as most likely reecting the manner in
which a MARS multiresponse model uses information across
the full suite of species in selecting which predictors to use in
forming basis functions, i.e., relevant predictors are included
because of their strong community signal, whereas that signal
might be insufcient to trigger inclusion of these predictors
when tting a single species model (Guisan et al., 1999). In
addition, more prevalent species are likely to inuence the
selection of a larger set of relevant predictors than would be
selected if rare species were analysed on their own. While
this might introduce some risk that models for rare species
are over-tted, it has the advantage that the distributions
of rare species are modelled within the same environmental
framework as their more widespread counterparts. As a con-
sequence, predicted distributions for rarer species are more

likely to coincide with the distributions of those common
species with which they co-occur. While we performed our
analyses with equal weights applied to all species, some ben-
et might be derived from altering weights to increase the
inuence of widespread species where these are of particu-
lar interest.

In conceptual terms, such a model can be seen as strongly
convergent with the purposes of canonical correspondence
analysis (CCAter Braak, 1987), an ordination technique that
is widely used to relate community patterns to environment.
However, this latter technique makes a number of important
assumptions including that both species niche breadths and
maximum abundances are equal, and that both the distribu-
tions of species responses to environment across plots and
of species abundances within plots are Gaussian in shape. In
addition, analysis is constrained so that the canonical axes
are composed of linear combinations of environmental vari-
ables. While CCA is considered robust to departures from these
assumptions, uncertainty remains about the degree to which
the effects of such departures affect analysis results (see
Austin, 2002). Given that the majority of ecological datasets
are unlikely to meet these assumptions, we suggest that MARS
offers an important alternative for the analysis of relation-
ships between environment and community composition. As
our results show, it is capable of both identifying the most
parsimonious set of environmental predictors that explain
variation in multiresponse composition, and robustly describ-
ing the distributions of species within the multi-dimensional
space dened by these predictors. Most importantly, MARS
achieves this using statistical techniques that accommodate
robustly the widely varying and generally non-linear relation-
ships that exist between species and their environment. This
could also have important applications for the modelling of
rare species, which although difcult to model well, are often
the focus of conservation effort.

Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the enor-
mous effort that went into the assembly of the New Zealand
Freshwater Fish Database, which was instigated by Bob
McDowall and is maintained by Jody Richardsonparticularly
thanks are owed to numerous researchers who have con-
tributed their data over several decades. Similar credit must
be given to those who developed major databases describing
environmental variation in New Zealands rivers and streams,
and in particular Ton Snelder, Mark Weatherhead and Helen
Hurren. The inspiration for a comparative analysis of GAM and
MARS models was generated by discussions at a workshop on
statistical modelling of species distributions held in Riederalp,
Switzerland, in August 2004. This work was funded by New
Zealands Foundation for Research, Science and Technology
under contract C01X0305.
