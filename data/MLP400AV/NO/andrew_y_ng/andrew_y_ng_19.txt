Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for nding succinct representations
of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis functions that cap-
ture higher-level features in the data. However, nding sparse codes remains a
very difcult computational problem. In this paper, we present efcient sparse
coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization
problems: an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained least
squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimiza-
tion problems. Our algorithms result in a signicant speedup for sparse coding,
allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described
algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the
inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive eld sur-
round suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two
phenomena in V1 neurons.

1 Introduction
Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for nding succinct representations of stimuli; given
only unlabeled input data, it learns basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data.
When a sparse coding algorithm is applied to natural images, the learned bases resemble the recep-
tive elds of neurons in the visual cortex [1, 2]; moreover, sparse coding produces localized bases
when applied to other natural stimuli such as speech and video [3, 4]. Unlike some other unsuper-
vised learning techniques such as PCA, sparse coding can be applied to learning overcomplete basis
sets, in which the number of bases is greater than the input dimension. Sparse coding can also model
inhibition between the bases by sparsifying their activations. Similar properties have been observed
in biological neurons, thus making sparse coding a plausible model of the visual cortex [2, 5].
Despite the rich promise of sparse coding models, we believe that their development has been ham-
pered by their expensive computational cost.
In particular, learning large, highly overcomplete
representations has been extremely expensive. In this paper, we develop a class of efcient sparse
coding algorithms that are based on alternating optimization over two subsets of the variables. The
optimization problems over each of the subsets of variables are convex; in particular, the optimiza-
tion over the rst subset is an L1-regularized least squares problem; the optimization over the sec-
ond subset of variables is an L2-constrained least squares problem. We describe each algorithm
and empirically analyze their performance. Our method allows us to efciently learn large over-
complete bases from natural images. We demonstrate that the resulting learned bases exhibit (i)
end-stopping [6] and (ii) modulation by stimuli outside the classical receptive eld (nCRF surround
suppression) [7]. Thus, sparse coding may also provide a partial explanation for these phenomena in
V1 neurons. Further, in related work [8], we show that the learned succinct representation captures
higher-level features that can then be applied to supervised classication tasks.
2 Preliminaries
The goal of sparse coding is to represent input vectors approximately as a weighted linear combi-
nation of a small number of (unknown) basis vectors. These basis vectors thus capture high-level
patterns in the input data. Concretely, each input vector ~  Rk is succinctly represented using
basis vectors ~b1, . . . ,~bn  Rk and a sparse vector of weights or coefcients ~s  Rn such that

distribution for each coefcient sj is dened as: P (sj)  exp((sj)), where () is a sparsity
function and  is a constant. For example, we can use one of the following:

In this paper, we will use the L1 penalty unless otherwise mentioned; L1 regularization is known to
produce sparse coefcients and can be robust to irrelevant features [9].
Consider a training set of m input vectors ~(1), ..., ~(m), and their (unknown) corresponding coef-
cients ~s(1), ..., ~s(m). The maximum a posteriori estimate of the bases and coefcients, assuming a
uniform prior on the bases, is the solution to the following optimization problem:1

This problem can be written more concisely in matrix form: let X  Rkm be the input matrix (each
column is an input vector), let B  Rkn be the basis matrix (each column is a basis vector), and let
S  Rnm be the coefcient matrix (each column is a coefcient vector). Then, the optimization
problem above can be written as:

Assuming the use of either L1 penalty or epsilonL1 penalty as the sparsity function, the optimization
problem is convex in B (while holding S xed) and convex in S (while holding B xed),2 but
not convex in both simultaneously. In this paper, we iteratively optimize the above objective by
alternatingly optimizing with respect to B (bases) and S (coefcients) while holding the other xed.
For learning the bases B, the optimization problem is a least squares problem with quadratic con-
straints. There are several approaches to solving this problem, such as generic convex optimization
solvers (e.g., QCQP solver) as well as gradient descent using iterative projections [10]. However,
generic convex optimization solvers are too slow to be applicable to this problem, and gradient de-
scent using iterative projections often shows slow convergence. In this paper, we derive and solve
the Lagrange dual, and show that this approach is much more efcient than gradient-based methods.
For learning the coefcients S, the optimization problem is equivalent to a regularized least squares
problem. For many differentiable sparsity functions, we can use gradient-based methods (e.g., con-
jugate gradient). However, for the L1 sparsity function, the objective is not continuously differen-
tiable and the most straightforward gradient-based methods are difcult to apply. In this case, the
following approaches have been used: generic QP solvers (e.g., CVX), Chen et al.s interior point
method [11], a modication of least angle regression (LARS) [12], or grafting [13]. In this paper,
we present a new algorithm for solving the L1-regularized least squares problem and show that it is
more efcient for learning sparse coding bases.
3 L1-regularized least squares: The feature-sign search algorithm
Consider solving the optimization problem (2) with an L1 penalty over the coefcients {s(i)
keeping the bases xed. This problem can be solved by optimizing over each ~s(i) individually:

2A log (non-convex) penalty was used in [1]; thus, gradient-based methods can get stuck in local optima.

j = 0). Considering only nonzero coefcients, this reduces (4) to a standard, unconstrained
quadratic optimization problem (QP), which can be solved analytically and efciently. Our algo-
rithm, therefore, tries to search for, or guess, the signs of the coefcients s(i)
j ; given any such
guess, we can efciently solve the resulting unconstrained QP. Further, the algorithm systematically
renes the guess if it turns out to be initially incorrect.
To simplify notation, we present the algorithm for the following equivalent optimization problem:

minimizexf(x)  ky  Axk2 + kxk1,

(5)
where  is a constant. The feature-sign search algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. It maintains an
active set of potentially nonzero coefcients and their corresponding signsall other coefcients
must be zeroand systematically searches for the optimal active set and coefcient signs. The
algorithm proceeds in a series of feature-sign steps: on each step, it is given a current guess for the
active set and the signs, and it computes the analytical solution xnew to the resulting unconstrained
QP; it then updates the solution, the active set and the signs using an efcient discrete line search
between the current solution and xnew (details in Algorithm 1).3 We will show that each such step
reduces the objective f(x), and that the overall algorithm always converges to the optimal solution.

Let A be a submatrix of A that contains only the columns corresponding to the active set.
Let x and  be subvectors of x and  corresponding to the active set.
Compute the analytical solution to the resulting unconstrained QP (minimizexky  Axk2 +  > x):

xnew := ( A> A)1( A>y   /2),

Perform a discrete line search on the closed line segment from x to xnew:

Check the objective value at xnew and all points where any coefcient changes sign.
Update x (and the corresponding entries in x) to the point with the lowest objective value.

Remove zero coefcients of x from the active set and update  := sign(x).

If condition (a) is not satised, go to Step 3 (without any new activation); else check condition (b).

If condition (b) is not satised, go to Step 2; otherwise return x as the solution.

To sketch the proof of convergence, let a coefcient vector x be called consistent with a given active
set and sign vector  if the following two conditions hold for all i: (i) If i is in the active set, then
sign(xi) = i, and, (ii) If i is not in the active set, then xi = 0.
Lemma 3.1. Consider optimization problem (5) augmented with the additional constraint that x is
consistent with a given active set and sign vector. Then, if the current coefcients xc are consistent
with the active set and sign vector, but are not optimal for the augmented problem at the start of
Step 3, the feature-sign step is guaranteed to strictly reduce the objective.
Proof sketch. Let xc be the subvector of xc corresponding to coefcients in the given active set. In
Step 3, consider a smooth quadratic function f(x)  ky Axk2 +  >x. Since xc is not an optimal
point of f, we have f(xnew) < f(xc). Now consider the two possible cases: (i) if xnew is consistent
with the given active set and sign vector, updating x := xnew strictly decreases the objective; (ii) if
xnew is not consistent with the given active set and sign vector, let xd be the rst zero-crossing point
(where any coefcient changes its sign) on a line segment from xc to xnew, then clearly xc 6= xd,
3A technical detail has been omitted from the algorithm for simplicity, as we have never observed it in prac-
tice. In Step 3 of the algorithm, in case A> A becomes singular, we can check if q  A>y  /2  R( A> A).
If yes, we can replace the inverse with the pseudoinverse to minimize the unconstrained QP; otherwise, we can
update x to the rst zero-crossing along any direction z such that z  N ( A> A), z>q 6= 0. Both these steps
are still guaranteed to reduce the objective; thus, the proof of convergence is unchanged.

xi

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) kyAxk2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) > ; this i-th coefcient is activated, and

and f(xd) < f(xc) by convexity of f, thus we nally have f(xd) = f(xd) < f(xc) = f(xc).4
Therefore, the discrete line search described in Step 3 ensures a decrease in the objective value.
Lemma 3.2. Consider optimization problem (5) augmented with the additional constraint that x
is consistent with a given active set and sign vector. If the coefcients xc at the start of Step 2 are
optimal for the augmented problem, but are not optimal for problem (5), the feature-sign step is
guaranteed to strictly reduce the objective.
Proof sketch. Since xc is optimal for the augmented problem, it satises optimality condition (a), but
not (b); thus, in Step 2, there is some i, such that
i is added to the active set. In Step 3, consider the smooth quadratic function f(x)  ky  Axk2 +
 >x. Observe that (i) since a Taylor expansion of f around x = xc has a rst order term in xi only
(using condition 4(a) for the other coefcients), we have that any direction that locally decreases
f(x) must be consistent with the sign of the activated xi, and, (ii) since xc is not an optimal point
of f(x), f(x) must decrease locally near x = xc along the direction from xc to xnew. From (i) and
(ii), the line search direction xc to xnew must be consistent with the sign of the activated xi. Finally,
since f(x) = f(x) when x is consistent with the active set, either xnew is consistent, or the rst
zero-crossing from xc to xnew has a lower objective value (similar argument to Lemma 3.1).
Theorem 3.3. The feature-sign search algorithm converges to a global optimum of the optimization
problem (5) in a nite number of steps.
Proof sketch. From the above lemmas, it follows that the feature-sign steps always strictly reduce
the objective f(x). At the start of Step 2, x either satises optimality condition 4(a) or is ~0; in
either case, x is consistent with the current active set and sign vector, and must be optimal for the
augmented problem described in the above lemmas. Since the number of all possible active sets and
coefcient signs is nite, and since no pair can be repeated (because the objective value is strictly
decreasing), the outer loop of Steps 24(b) cannot repeat indenitely. Now, it sufces to show that a
nite number of steps is needed to reach Step 4(b) from Step 2. This is true because the inner loop of
Steps 34(a) always results in either an exit to Step 4(b) or a decrease in the size of the active set.
Note that initialization with arbitrary starting points requires a small modication: after initializing 
and the active set with a given initial solution, we need to start with Step 3 instead of Step 1.5 When
the initial solution is near the optimal solution, feature-sign search can often obtain the optimal
solution more quickly than when starting from ~0.
4 Learning bases using the Lagrange dual
In this subsection, we present a method for solving optimization problem (3) over bases B given
xed coefcients S. This reduces to the following problem:
kX  BSk2
i,j  c,j = 1, ..., n.
nX

This is a least squares problem with quadratic constraints. In general, this constrained optimization
problem can be solved using gradient descent with iterative projection [10]. However, it can be
much more efciently solved using a Lagrange dual. First, consider the Lagrangian:

the coefcients in x as variables, and all coefcients not in the subvector can be assumed constant at zero.

Table 1: The running time in seconds (and the relative error in parentheses) for coefcient learning
algorithms applied to different natural stimulus datasets. For each dataset, the input dimension k
and the number of bases n are specied as k  n. The relative error for an algorithm was dened as
(fobj  f)/f, where fobj is the nal objective value attained by that algorithm, and f is the best
objective value attained among all the algorithms.
where ei  Rn is the i-th unit vector. Now, we can optimize the Lagrange dual (8) using Newtons
method or conjugate gradient. After maximizing D(~), we obtain the optimal bases B as follows:
(11)

B> = (SS> + )1(XS>)>.

The advantage of solving the dual is that it uses signicantly fewer optimization variables than the
primal. For example, optimizing B  R1,0001,000 requires only 1,000 dual variables. Note that
the dual formulation is independent of the sparsity function (e.g., L1, epsilonL1, or other sparsity
function), and can be extended to other similar models such as topographic cells [14].6
5 Experimental results
5.1 The feature-sign search algorithm
We evaluated the performance of our algorithms on four natural stimulus datasets: natural images,
speech, stereo images, and natural image videos. All experiments were conducted on a Linux ma-
chine with AMD Opteron 2GHz CPU and 2GB RAM.
First, we evaluated the feature-sign search algorithm for learning coefcients with the L1 sparsity
function. We compared the running time and accuracy to previous state-of-the-art algorithms:
a generic QP solver,7 a modied version of LARS [12] with early stopping,8 grafting [13], and
Chen et al.s interior point method [11];9 all the algorithms were implemented in MATLAB. For
each dataset, we used a test set of 100 input vectors and measured the running time10 and the
objective function at convergence. Table 1 shows both the running time and accuracy (measured
by the relative error in the nal objective value) of different coefcient learning algorithms. Over
all datasets, feature-sign search achieved the best objective values as well as the shortest running
times. Feature-sign search and modied LARS produced more accurate solutions than the other
methods.11 Feature-sign search was an order of magnitude faster than both Chen et al.s algorithm
and the generic QP solver, and it was also signicantly faster than modied LARS and grafting.
Moreover, feature-sign search has the crucial advantage that it can be initialized with arbitrary
starting coefcients (unlike LARS); we will demonstrate that feature-sign search leads to even
further speedup over LARS when applied to iterative coefcient learning.

5.2 Total time for learning bases
The Lagrange dual method for one basis learning iteration was much faster than gradient descent
with iterative projections, and we omit discussion of those results due to space constraints. Below,
we directly present results for the overall time taken by sparse coding for learning bases from natural
stimulus datasets.

6The sparsity penalty for topographic cells can be written asP

function and cell l is a topographic cell (e.g., group of neighboring bases in 2-D torus representation).

7We used the CVX package available at http://www.stanford.edu/boyd/cvx/.
8LARS (with LASSO modication) provides the entire regularization path with discrete L1-norm con-
straints; we further modied the algorithm so that it stops upon nding the optimal solution of the Equation (4).

9MATLAB code is available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/atomizer/.
10For each dataset/algorithm combination, we report the average running time over 20 trials.
11A general-purpose QP package (such as CVX) does not explicitly take the sparsity of the solutions into
account. Thus, its solution tends to have many very small nonzero coefcients; as a result, the objective values
obtained from CVX were always slightly worse than those obtained from feature-sign search or LARS.

functions.

Figure 1: Demonstration of speedup. Left: Comparison of convergence between the Lagrange dual
method and gradient descent for learning bases. Right: The running time per iteration for modied
LARS and grafting as a multiple of the running time per iteration for feature-sign search.

We evaluated different combinations of coefcient learning and basis learning algorithms: the fastest
coefcient learning methods from our experiments (feature-sign search, modied LARS and graft-
ing for the L1 sparsity function, and conjugate gradient for the epsilonL1 sparsity function) and the
state-of-the-art basis learning methods (gradient descent with iterative projection and the Lagrange
dual formulation). We used a training set of 1,000 input vectors for each of the four natural stimulus
datasets. We initialized the bases randomly and ran each algorithm combination (by alternatingly
optimizing the coefcients and the bases) until convergence.12
Table 2 shows the running times for different algorithm combinations. First, we observe that the
Lagrange dual method signicantly outperformed gradient descent with iterative projections for
both L1 and epsilonL1 sparsity; a typical convergence pattern is shown in Figure 1 (left). Second,
we observe that, for L1 sparsity, feature-sign search signicantly outperformed both modied LARS
and grafting.13 Figure 1 (right) shows the running time per iteration for modied LARS and grafting
as a multiple of that for feature-sign search (using the same gradient descent algorithm for basis
learning), demonstrating signicant efciency gains at later iterations; note that feature-sign search
(and grafting) can be initialized with the coefcients obtained in the previous iteration, whereas
modied LARS cannot. This result demonstrates that feature-sign search is particularly efcient for
iterative optimization, such as learning sparse coding bases.

5.3 Learning highly overcomplete natural image bases
Using our efcient algorithms, we were able to learn highly overcomplete bases of natural images
as shown in Figure 2. For example, we were able to learn a set of 1,024 bases (each 1414 pixels)
12We ran each algorithm combination until the relative change of the objective per iteration became less than
106 (i.e., |(fnew  fold)/fold| < 106). To compute the running time to convergence, we rst computed
the optimal (minimum) objective value achieved by any algorithm combination. Then, for each combination,
we dened the convergence point as the point at which the objective value reaches within 1% relative error of
the observed optimal objective value. The running time measured is the time taken to reach this convergence
point. We truncated the running time if the optimization did not converge within 60,000 seconds.

13We also evaluated a generic conjugate gradient implementation on the L1 sparsity function; however, it did

not converge even after 60,000 seconds.

in about 2 hours and a set of 2,000 bases (each 2020 pixels) in about 10 hours.14 In contrast, the
gradient descent method for basis learning did not result in any reasonable bases even after running
for 24 hours. Further, summary statistics of our learned bases, obtained by tting the Gabor function
parameters to each basis, qualitatively agree with previously reported statistics [15].
5.4 Replicating complex neuroscience phenomena
Several complex phenomena of V1 neural responses are not well explained by simple linear models
(in which the response is a linear function of the input). For instance, many visual neurons display
end-stopping, in which the neurons response to a bar image of optimal orientation and placement
is actually suppressed as the bar length exceeds an optimal length [6]. Sparse coding can model the
interaction (inhibition) between the bases (neurons) by sparsifying their coefcients (activations),
and our algorithms enable these phenomena to be tested with highly overcomplete bases.
First, we evaluated whether end-stopping behavior could be observed in the sparse coding frame-
work. We generated random bars with different orientations and lengths in 1414 image patches,
and picked the stimulus bar which most strongly activates each basis, considering only the bases
which are signicantly activated by one of the test bars. For each such highly activated basis, and
the corresponding optimal bar position and orientation, we vary length of the bar from 1 pixel to
the maximal size and run sparse coding to measure the coefcients for the selected basis, relative to
their maximum coefcient. As shown in Figure 3 (left), for highly overcomplete bases, we observe
many cases in which the coefcient decreases signicantly as the bar length is increased beyond the
optimal point. This result is consistent with the end-stopping behavior of some V1 neurons.
Second, using the learned overcomplete bases, we tested for center-surround non-classical receptive
eld (nCRF) effects [7]. We found the optimal bar stimuli for 50 random bases and checked that
these bases were among the most strongly activated ones for the optimal stimulus. For each of these

14We used Lagrange dual formulation for learning bases, and both conjugate gradient with epsilonL1 sparsity
as well as the feature-sign search with L1 sparsity for learning coefcients. The bases learned from both
methods showed qualitatively similar receptive elds. The bases shown in the Figure 2 were learned using
epsilonL1 sparsity function and 4,000 input image patches randomly sampled for every iteration.

bases, we measured the response with its optimal bar stimulus with and without the aligned bar
stimulus in the surround region (Figure 3 (right)). We then compared the basis response in these two
cases to measure the suppression or facilitation due to the surround stimulus. The aligned surround
stimuli produced a suppression of basis activation; 42 out of 50 bases showed suppression with
aligned surround input images, and 13 bases among them showed more than 10% suppression, in
qualitative accordance with observed nCRF surround suppression effects.
6 Application to self-taught learning
Sparse coding is an unsupervised algorithm that learns to represent input data succinctly using only
a small number of bases. For example, using the image edge bases in Figure 2, it represents a new
image patch ~ as a linear combination of just a small number of these bases ~bj. Informally, we think
of this as nding a representation of an image patch in terms of the edges in the image; this gives
a slightly higher-level/more abstract representation of the image than the pixel intensity values, and
is useful for a variety of tasks.
In related work [8], we apply this to self-taught learning, a new machine learning formalism in
which we are given a supervised learning problem together with additional unlabeled instances that
may not have the same class labels as the labeled instances. For example, one may wish to learn
to distinguish between cars and motorcycles given images of each, and additionaland in practice
readily availableunlabeled images of various natural scenes. (This is in contrast to the much more
restrictive semi-supervised learning problem, which would require that the unlabeled examples also
be of cars or motorcycles only.) We apply our sparse coding algorithms to the unlabeled data to
learn bases, which gives us a higher-level representation for images, thus making the supervised
learning task easier. On a variety of problems including object recognition, audio classication, and
text categorization, this approach leads to 1136% reductions in test error.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we formulated sparse coding as a combination of two convex optimization problems
and presented efcient algorithms for each: the feature-sign search for solving the L1-least squares
problem to learn coefcients, and a Lagrange dual method for the L2-constrained least squares
problem to learn the bases for any sparsity penalty function. We test these algorithms on a variety
of datasets, and show that they give signicantly better performance compared to previous methods.
Our algorithms can be used to learn an overcomplete set of bases, and show that sparse coding could
partially explain the phenomena of end-stopping and nCRF surround suppression in V1 neurons.
