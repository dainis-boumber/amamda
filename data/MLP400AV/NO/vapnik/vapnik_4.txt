Introduction

According to the classical Bernoulli theorem, the relative frequency of
an event A in a sequence of independent trials converges (in probability) to
the probability of that event. In many applications, however, the need
arises to judge simultaneously the probabilities of events of an entire class S
from one and the same sample. Moreover, it is required that the relative
frequency of the events converge to the probability uniformly over the entire
class of events S. More precisely, it is required that the probability that the
maximum difference (over the class) between the relative frequency and the
probability exceed a given arbitrarily small positive constant should tend
to zero as the number of trials is increased indefinitely. It turns out that
even in the simplest of examples this sort of uniform convergence need not
hold. Therefore, one would like to have criteria on the basis of which one
could judge whether there is such convergence or not.

This paper first indicates sufficient conditions for such uniform con-
vergence which do not depend on the distribution properties and furnishes
an estimate for the speed of convergence. Then necessary and sufficient
conditions are deduced for the relative frequency to converge uniformly
to the probability. These conditions do depend on the distribution properties.

The main results of the paper were stated in 1.
Let X be a set of elementary events on which a probability measure
Px is defined. Let S be a collection of random events, i.e., of subsets of the
space X, which are measurable with respect to the measure Px. Let Xl)
denote the space of samples in X of size I. On the space X<l) we define a
probability measure P by

where the Y are measurable subsets of X.

for A equal to the quotient of the number na of those elements of the sample

The quantity rctl is a point function in Xt/-space. We shall assume that this
function is measurable with respect to measure in Xtl, i.e., that rttt is a random

If the variable rttl converges in probability to zero as the sample size

is increased indefinitely, then we shall say that the relative frequency of
events A S tends (in probability) to the probability of these events uniformly
over the class S. The subsequent theorems are devoted to estimates for the
probability of the events{rt/) > e} and to a clarification of conditions under

1. Sufficient Conditions not Depending on Distribution Properties

1. Subsidiary definitions. Let X- x t,..., x be a finite sample of
elements in X. Each set A in S determines in this sample a subsample Xff
x,..., x consisting of those terms of the sample X which belong to
A. We shall say that the set A induces the subsample X in the sample X.
We denote the set of all different subsamples induced by the sets of S in the
sample X by S(x,..., x) or S(X). The number of different subsamples
of the sample X induced by the sets in S will be termed the index of the
system S with respect to the sample x,..., x and will be denoted by
AS(x, ..., x). Obviously, AS(x,

x) is always at most 2. The function

where the maximum is taken over all samples of size r, will be called the
growth function.

Further, all subsamples induced by the sets in S in the sample X,_ may be
split into two types. To the first type belongs every subsample t induced by
S in X_ such that only one of the subsamples is induced in the whole
sample X: either t or t, x,. To the second belong those t for which both t
and t, x are induced in the whole sample. Correspondingly, the set S is
partitioned into two subsets: the subset S which induces subsamples of the
first type and the subset S" which induces subsamples of the second type.

Let a be the number of elements in the set of subsamples of the first type
and b the number of elements in the set of subsamples of the second type.
Then the following relations hold:

In a similar way, we can satisfy ourselves that uniform convergence
with probability one also holds for the class of events considered in Example 3
of Subsection 1.

The class of events considered in Example 2 does not satisfy the sufficient

conditions.

In many applications, it is important to know what the sample size
must be in order that, with probability at least (1- r/), one could assert
that the relative frequencies differ from their corresponding probabilities by
an amount less than e simultaneously over the entire class of events.

Observe that all permutations T can be classified into groups R
corresponding to the same partition into the first and second semi-sample.
The value of p")(TX2t) does not change within the framework of one group.
The number of permutations in all the groups is the same and equal to (/!)2.
The number of groups is (]). Thus,

By Lemma 1, taking into consideration that X2l satisfies (24) we can
pick out a subsample y in this sample of size n such that S induces all possible
subsamples in it. The partition R is completely prescribed if the partition Nk
of the subsample y and the partition Mj of the subsample X2
y are given.
Let R NkMj. Let r(k) be the number of elements in the subsample
y which belong, under the partition Nk, to the first semi-sample and s(j)
the number of elements of subsample X2I
y which belong, under partition
M, to the first semi-sample. Clearly, r(k) + s(j)
for k and j corresponding
to the same partition R. We have

we can specify a set A(k) S such that A(k) includes exactly the elements of
subsample y which belong under partition Nk to the first semi-sample.

Introduce the notation" t(k) is the number of elements in subsample
X21- y belonging to A(k), u(k,j) is the number of elements in X21- y in
A(k) belonging, under partition M, to the first semi-sample. Then v]()

We further take into account that SUPAss PA >= PA(k)and replacing SUPAs Pn
by Pa(k) we estimate Z to obtain

The expression in the last sum is nothing else than the probability of drawing

By direct verification it is easy to show that, for 7e _< r/l <= q + e and > l/e,
