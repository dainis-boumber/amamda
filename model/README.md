designing a new method has now been simplified to the space of making
three design choices:

1. Generative or discriminative base model (label_classfifer)?

2. Tie or untie the weights between domain encoder & domain classifier?

3. Which adversarial learning objective to use?

See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05464.pdf for clarification.
