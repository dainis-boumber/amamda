Headers and Footers can be switched on or off here. I use headers to display the document title. In the Footer I place my ©copyright notice, page number, page count, date and so on.
Footnote and endnote preferences can be set here. If you don’t know what these are you probably do not need them, unless you are a student, then you will need to find out about this. Whilst eluding to academic practice Pages supports the Thomson Reuters EndNote and Design Science’s MathsType plug–ins.
Hyphenation and ligatures are typographic terms. For left aligned type there is no need to check the Hyphenation button. Though I recommend using ligatures.
The bottom section is Require Password To Open. For additional security a password can be entered to lock a Pages document. The password would then be required every-time the document is opened.
The next tab is TOC, or Table Of Contents. There is practical exercise on using Table Of Contents in the Sharing Your Work chapter. Table Of Contents only makes sense when Style Sheets are properly understood. We’ll be looking at Style Sheets later.
The last tab is Info. Completing the fields for Author, Title, Keywords, and Comments is recommended practice. It makes documents easier to search for, especially if using the Mac’s Spotlight search. All of these fields are for metadata. Author and Title are self-explanatory. Adding Keywords helps classify a document, for example I wrote this Bookboon book using Pages. So this Pages document could have the keywords, ‘Apple’, ‘Pages’, ‘Bookboon’, ‘software training’ and ‘free download version’. The list could go on. There are five keywords here. Keywords are denoted by commas, ‘Apple, Pages, Bookboon’.
Also note that ‘software training’ and ‘free download version’ are both single keywords. Searches can be case-sensitive, but using ‘apple’ and ‘Apple’ as keywords is not strictly necessary. When choosing keywords it is helpful to invoke the spirit of the librarian and embrace formal cataloguing techniques. A less rigorous form of applying metadata is using the Comments field. Here paragraphs of descriptive text can be added. In the example of this book, the comments field could read, ‘Bookboon software training handbook for Apple Pages part of iWork.’
The next part of Info displays statistics for the current Pages document; the word count, amount of pages et cetera. The Range menu only becomes active is text is selected. When Range is greyed out you are reviewing statistics for the entire document. Document statistics are also available at the bottom of the document window. Next to this word count the current page number and total pages is listed. Click on this text and type a page number to jump to that page.
• Layout Inspector
With two tabs, Layout and Section, the Layout Inspector requires an understanding of page design and long–document management to fully understand its relevance.
Layout has a Column control. The Format Bar also has a Column menu, but the Inspector allows you to create columns of differing widths. Columns can be inset to give you some of the control graphic designers require from desktop publishing’s heavy–hitters, QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign.
The Section tab is useful for long–document management. If this were a larger book I would have split the chapters into separate sections and from the Configuration options set Section starts on: Right Page. Page Numbers can be configured so that a book’s preface uses a different numbering sequence than the main body of the book. To repeat an earlier point, this Inspector will mean more to those with page design knowledge, or those that need to manage longer documents.
• Wrap Inspector
The Wrap Inspector controls how text interacts with graphic objects, including photographs. For most documents the Object Placement should be set to Inline (moves with text). This causes in graphics to sit in the body of the text. If text is added or deleted the graphic will move with the change; keeping its relative position in the text. Inline (moves with text) automatically wraps text, so there is no need to adjust the Object causes wrap parameters.
If you chose Object Placement, Floating (doesn’t move with text) text can be obscured by the object. As the name suggests Floating lets you position the object anywhere on the page, but it will not keep its relative position in the text; the object remains where you placed it. To get text to wrap select the object and chose one of the wrap options. The wrap button icons are clues to what they do.
Text Fit is a little more esoteric. Look at the two buttons for Text Fit. The button on the left shows a triangle in the middle of some text (that is what the lines indicate). The text wraps to a square, because the imported object sit on a square canvas. Text will wrap to the boundaries of the imported object and not the image shape on that object. Imported objects can have invisible borders applied, known as Alpha Channels. Pages can access Alpha Channel information to draw irregular text wrap borders, see the green star text wrap example. The second Text Fit button shows the Text Wrap conforming to the triangle shape. Alpha channels can be applied to pictures from within Pages. Extra Space forces text to wrap further away from the wrap object. With wraps made on an alpha channel, the Alpha parameter changes the wrap based on the transparency of the alpha object. Rarely would you need to change the Alpha Text Fit value.
• Text Inspector –
Text can be controlled from five locations:
• Menu Bar > Fonts
• Menu Bar > Text
• The Fonts window, launched from the Tool Bar or using Command T
• The Format Bar
• Or in the Text Inspector. 
Each location has some unique and some shared functions. 
The Text Inspector has four tabs, Text, List Tabs and More. Text is probably the most readily understood, followed by List. Although many people use Tabs, or Tabulation. I have found that many people only vaguely understand the underpinning concept of tabulation, therefore I will explain some tabulation basics later.
So, back to the Text tab. This can be used for Character alignment horizontally, and also vertically. The colour of type can be changed too. Similar controls can be found in the Format Bar. The unique parameters here are the Spacing controls. Character Spacing, also known as Tracking, adjusts the space between letters, whereas Line Spacing, also known as Leading, adjusts the height of lines of type.
