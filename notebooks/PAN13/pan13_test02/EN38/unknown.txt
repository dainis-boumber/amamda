The order of the filter can be increased to obtain a smaller passband width and to obtain a frequency
response closer to the ideal ‘square’ filter. The sum filter in (4.3) had an order of 1; if we cascaded
another first order sum filter, we will have the block diagram shown in Figure 4.18 (we’ll drop the
constants for simplicity of discussion):
Solving for z[n] in Figure 4.18 will give
Eq. (4.5) could be easily verified by replacing values for x[n]. For example, using x[1]=3, x[2]=2 and
x[3]=5 and computing z[3] for the single cascaded second order filter will give 12. Computation
using two first order filters (i.e. y[2] and y[3]) will give the same result.
It should be noted that z[n] in the example above will be defined only for n=3 onwards if x[1] is the
starting point of the signal, i.e. for every order M, M initial data points will be lost in filtering.
Likewise y[n] in (4.3) is defined only from y[2] onwards.
For order M, we have
As an example, for order M=3, we will have
The magnitude response is given in Figure 4.19.
The passband is about 0.302  rad or  Fs/6. It could be seen that with increasing order, the passband
is becoming smaller without any change in stopband. Also, the response is becoming closer to the
ideal ‘square’. So, we can increase/decrease M depending on the requirements. The 3-dB cut-off
frequency is given by
Similarly for the HPF with order N, we will have
and the magnitude response as
Similarly, a BPF can be designed using a combination of LPF and HPF. This BPF is known as sum
and difference (SD) filter. Different orders, M and N can be chosen to obtain the required frequency
response [1]:
where Gaincf is the gain at centre frequency given by
For example, with filter orders of M=28 and N=8 gives the centre frequency of 40 Hz when Fs=256
Hz. The approximate 3 dB bandwidth is from 32 to 48 Hz (rounded to the nearest integer) and the
gain amplification at 40 Hz is approximately 47.21. Figure 4.20 shows this example using different
filter orders but with similar centre frequency (which is dependent on ratio of M/N).
As another example, let us obtain the band pass FIR filter expression for orders, LPF, M=4 and HPF,
N=1, i.e. obtain the band pass FIR equation that expresses z[n] in terms of x[n] and delays of x[n].
Using (4.6), obtain y[n] in term of x[n] and using (4.10), obtain z[n] in terms y[n]. Next, replace y[n]
in the latter expression to arrive at
The SD filter that we studied in the previous section is simple to design but for practical purposes, we
often need filters that can be tailored to suit our required specifications. Consider doing an inverse
DFT of the ideal LPF shown in Figure 4.1 (a) to obtain what is known as the impulse response,
which are basically the filter coefficients20.
The impulse response is actually the sinc function given by
It would be obvious that we will not be able to use hLPF as the filter coefficients as the length is
infinite. So we could use a rectangular window, w[n] to truncate the impulse response. However, by
using a finite set of coefficients (i.e. impulse response), the shape of the magnitude response is
changed with ripples showing up as in Figure 4.20. This is known as the Gibbs phenomenon -
oscillatory behaviour in the magnitude responses caused by truncating the ideal impulse response
function (i.e. the rectangular window has an abrupt transition to zero). Gibbs phenomenon can be
reduced by
 using a window that tapers smoothly at each end such as Hamming, Hanning, triangular etc
(refer to Section 3.5 in the previous chapter);
 providing a smooth transition from passband to stopband in the magnitude specifications.
But a question which one may now raise is on the appropriate length of the filter. The filter length
(i.e. order) affects the magnitude response. With a length increase, the number of ripples in both
passband and stopband increases21 but with a corresponding decrease in the ripple widths, i.e. as N
increases, the magnitude response approaches closer to the ideal LPF (see Figure 4.21). Similar
oscillatory behaviour could be observed in the magnitude responses of the truncated versions of other
types of ideal filters.
There are several methods such as Kaiser and Bellanger formulas to select the ‘suitable’ order i.e. the
smallest length that can meet the requirements. Kaiser’s formula [2] is given by:
where  p and  s are the ripples in the passband and stopband, respectively while fp and fs are
passband and stopband edge frequencies. It should be obvious that the actual location of the
transition band is immaterial, only the transition width matters.
The next issue is on the choice of window, which could be decided using the areas under main lobe
and side lobes. Figure 4.22 shows two windows, Hanning and Blackman designed using order 101;
the main lobe is the first ripple while other ripples are known as side lobes.
To ensure a fast transition from passband to stopband, the window should have a very small main
lobe width (i.e. area under the main lobe should be small). For a reduction in the ripples, the area
under the sidelobes should be small (i.e. to increase the stopband attenuation, we need to decrease the
sidelobe amplitudes).
Most of the time, a compromise has to be met with regards to these two requirements (smaller main
lobe with smaller side lobes). Consider Figure 4.23, which shows LPF design with cut-off at Fs/2, i.e.
0.5 in normalised frequency using the two windows shown in Figure 4.22. From Figure 4.23, we can
see that Blackman window, which has smaller area under side lobes but bigger main lobe area, has a
higher attenuation in the stopband but with a higher width transition band. The case for Hanning
window is the opposite with smaller transition band but with lower stopband attenuation as it has
smaller main lobe area but bigger side lobes area.
