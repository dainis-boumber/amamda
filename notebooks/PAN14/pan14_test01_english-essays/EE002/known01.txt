 Increasing violence  In this essay I shall reflect over the increasing and raw violence on television, and what effect it might have on the viewers. 
The television is an amazing invention and has a lot of good qualities, but where there is good there is evil. 
Ten years ago watching television was quite harmless, although violence existed it was not as raw as it is today. 
Basically every action-film today contains very much unrealistic violence. 
Even the cartoons has a lot of violent elements and what kind of effect does that have on the young viewers? 
It is no secret that television has a strong impact on its viewers. 
Especially children, as they do not always realise what is real and what is fiction. 
To trick a child is not difficult and that is one of the reasons why children-commercials are forbidden in many countries. 
But what is scary is that there is very little restriction towards violent Tv-shows. 
Although there are age-limits and recommended parental advisory, children have very little trouble to circumvent these restrictions. 
There is an ongoing debate about how to solve this Tv-violence but very little is actually done. 
Adults still want to be able to look at these kinds of films so to ban all violet movies would be impossible. 
There is no easy solution to this problem but in the end parents are utmost responsible to protect their children.  	 
First, I believe we can all agree that violence on Tv have increased a lot. 
It has become a new kind of entertainment. 
Adults find violence entertaining and the film and movie makers respond by adding more and rawer violence and special effects. 
Adults can see the difference between real life and fiction. 
But children lack in experience and are often unableto see the difference. 
So Tv becomes reality and this can be observed by watching childrenplay. 
It is no longer innocent games, it can clearly be seen that television has had impact on them and children express feelings while playing. 
Today boys play "action-man" and girls play "model", nobody is interested in playing "house" anymore. 
Television reflects society and violence have increased not only on Tv but also in real life. 
One can wonder why is that so? 
Are people more evil today then ten years ago? 
How big part does television actually play? 
This issue raises more questions than answers but it is an important subject and it must be discussed, as we owe it to the children. 
One thing that could be done to protect the children is to broadcast violent films at a late hour, rather than displaying it during daytime. 
Here the responsibility lie on broadcasting companies however, parents must also take responsibility and really see to it that their children do not stay up late.  	 
Secondly, what kind of effect does too much television-violence have on children and young adults? 
In society today there has been a huge increasing rate of violent related crimes.
But what is new about these crimes are that the robbers and thieves are teenagers. 
What can be said about these teenagers are that they have got a twisted picture about society and reality. 
They take role models from films and these men and woman from "Hollywood" have very little to do with reality. 
What can be said about these role models is that they are "immortal" and can do anything they want. 
When teenagers interpreter these models the outcome is often wrong. 
It is not right to hurt people physically and you can not drive a car threw a mall and get away with it.  	 
Still, one must say that television is a good thing after all. 
Television is educating and one can get news and information from all over the world. 
However, there are still many things to improve. 
It is not necessary with all this violence but there is no easy solution to this problem. 
But first we must realise that it really is a problem and that it can not be ignored. 
Because what will happen to the youths if they continue to consume five hours of violence every day? 
They will become people without respect and with a twisted picture of life.
We must do something about this now before it is to late.
