 Summary of Anders Norling's article "Byt ledning i Uppsala buss!"  
Anders Norling will not pay any more taxes to Uppsala buss (UNT April 2nd). 
There is no wonder the company hasn't got any money because of the bad investments it has done. 
Those are for instance biogas busses, new technology and house building. 
He demands the resignation of the general manager of Uppsala buss; the faults must be paid for.  
In combination with faults and bad investments he addresses the nonexistent service Uppsala buss provides, for instance few tours, late busses and expensive bus fees. 
He also accuses Uppsala buss of having earned the reputation of being "a customer hostile company".  r Norling raises scepticism towards the company policy concerning lines facing close down and lines still kept in business. 
Same arguments are used, to few customers, for both issues.  
Uppsala buss, a great company!   
Anders Norling is totally on the wrong track when he discredits Uppsala buss. 
I commend the initiative of new technology and biogas busses taken by the management. 
To be able to purify the ancient combustion engine there must be some one who is willing to risk the reputation of being a too expensive alternative. 
How much is our mutual environment able to cope with?   
2300 oil discharges have been detected since 1995, which none of the accidents have lead to a conviction. 
(Uppdrag granskning, April 2nd) The inhabitants of the Danish east coast and the Swedish south coast will agree with me when I say that oil tanks must be stopped and alternative fuels must come out on the open market. 
The bold venture Uppsala buss has made cannot be seen other than a honourable attempt to lead our polluted society to a cleaner environment.  
To be leading in a vastly neglected area as the environment is bound to cost money and Uppsala buss has taken great steps towards being a leading company in that area. 
The noise and the exhaust have decreased after putting the biogas busses in use (www.uppsalabus.se) and that is inexorably a service improvement.  
Good service is also provided when you start looking at the bus connections, frequency and time aspects. 
A great number of tours (e.g. numbers 5, 6, 7 and 8) start around 5.30 pm and the latest bus is leaving its destination at 19.30 am (weekdays). 
Those four busses alone drive through a couple of Uppsala's biggest and most urbanised areas. 
(Stenhagen, Flogsta, City, Vilan, Eriksberg, Norby, Gottsunda, Nyby etc) (www.uppsalabus.se)  When evening comes the so-called "evening busses" starts to run. 
They are time connected, which means that when they meet up in the city with the rest of the busses, you do not have to wait for a connecting bus, that bus is already there. 
If you plan to go somewhere on the other side of the city, from where you live, that is a great advantage. 
On a weekday the last of these evening busses leaves its destination about 23.30 am. (www.uppsalabus.se)  Uppsala buss also has tours that are called the morning tours, there are seven of them and they start to run around 4 o'clock. 
(Weekdays).   
All this indicates that the number of tours and the tours spread around the clock (4 pm - 23.30 am weekdays) is quite substantial. 
Uppsala buss has a total of twenty-seven different tours around Uppsala with surroundings during the day, ten evening and night busses and seven in the early morning (www.uppsalabus.se). 
For a city with such a relatively small region, that is fully competitive.  
One of the problems a bus driver faces on a daily basis is that people tend to think that the bus is always late. 
If one thinks back to try to remember how many times one have run to the bus and missed it because the bus driver chooses to follow his time schedule? 
How angry doesn't that make you? 
But on the other hand, how many times have you stood on a bus stop waiting for that late bus to come? 
A numerous times as well, I would say. 
Shall the bus driver pick that late person up who is running towards the bus stop or shall he consider the passengers further ahead on the road that will have to wait another minute? 
Whatever he does, someone is inclined to get irritated. 
It is easy to be negative, but why not try to be positive?  
Uppsala has about 188 478 inhabitants and some of them live in a little smaller places that are located in the outskirts of the city. 
There are also bus passengers that have other needs concerning the busses spread through the city. 
Naturally, when these customer branches are quite small and do not uphold the material for a profitable market, there must be adjustments what cervices the bus company shall provide. 
Some of them get the fullest attention and some of them must be put on hold, or reduce the frequency, until there is a greater customer potential.  
This is the reason why some bus lines still run and some have to be closed down, on the account of the same reasoning, too little customer potential. 
Everyone must consider whether or not putting in tax money for upholding the service all people deserve, is a measurement worth doing.
