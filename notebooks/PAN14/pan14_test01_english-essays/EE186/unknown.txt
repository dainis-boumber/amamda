 What has caused the increase of racism in Sweden?  
The statement that racism in Sweden has increased during the 1990s could be argued against with the fact that there has not been an increase of racism related violence.1 But I would still like to state that racism has increased. 
As support of this I would like to stress the fact that many racist related crimes today are more serious and affects a greater variety of people than ten years ago. 
The crimes consist no longer "only" of taunts and assaults but also of murders, both planned and unplanned. 
An incident which caused quite a stir was the murder of Bjorn Soderberg this autumn. 
He was an active union member and represents the new victims of racism. 
These are journalists, politicians and anti-racists, that is people who have the courage to say no to racism and take side with the victims. 
I mean that racism in Sweden has increased and become more serious during the 1990s and the question I want to answer is why this has happened.2  	A commonly used argument to explain the occurrence of racism is the presence of the victims themselves, that is immigrants and people who have happened to be born with the "wrong" colour of their skin. 
You often hear the statement "the immigrants come and take our jobs". 
This could be a valid explanation since the 90s was the decade of unemployment in Sweden, but it's not the complete truth. 
I believe that most people realise that the immigrants do not only take our jobs, they also create new ones. 
People work with teaching their children and producing what they purchase too. 
Another explanation to why this argument can't be the only one is that it is not only immigrants who are victims of racism, but also Swedish-born people with the wrong colour of their skin and people who in the eyes of the racists choose the wrong side.  	
Secondly I want to mention the power-gaining argument, which would explain why there are new victims of racism. 
I believe that the purpose of racism is not only the expressing of sheer hate, but also a supposed way to power. 
You have a goal that you want to reach and you try to find the best way to reach that goal. 
When the economic situation is bad you come up with an explanation to this and the more supporters you get, the better. 
The racists blame the coloured people for everything and by using violent methods they gain power and a kind of negative respect. 
People become afraid of them and are forced to silence. 
This is why the racists have found new victims. 
They can't scare someone into changing the colour of their skin, but they can scare people into changing side. 
The fewer people on the victim's side, the more power to the racists. 
This explanation does not completely explain why racism exists though and that is why I have one last main cause. 	
The main reason for why there is racism in our society is based on social issues. 
As long as people have what they need and are satisfied with their life, they do not care about what other people have in the same degree. 
But when people are in a bad social situation with no job or money, they try to come up with an explanation for this. 
One way is to blame the immigrants for everything. 
Along with unemployment and a low social standard come many other explanations for racism. 
Problems with the economy can ruin any family's happiness and give children a lousy start in life. 
An example of the significance of a good social standard for people to avoid racism can be identified in France's political history. 
The party Front National's president candidate Le Pen failed completely in the election of 1974. 
But after times of recession in the beginning of the 80s FN started to gain power. 
Times were bad in France, FN presented an explanation for this by blaming the immigrants, and many people bought their explanation.3 The reason why this cause is not fully accepted is because it is an expensive one. 
To secure all people's welfare and happiness would cost a lot of money, though this money would save a lot of suffering and probably also money in other areas.  	
The main cause for explaining why racism has increased in Sweden during the 90s is of economical nature. 
The decade has been characterised by recession and the result is that people have tried to find an explanation for their suffering. 
The explanation has for many people ended up in racism. 
The only way to get rid of racism in our society is to secure all people's welfare.
