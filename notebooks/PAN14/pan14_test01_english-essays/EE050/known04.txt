 Good vs. 
Evil in the world of the Lowatts A discussion on the themes and settings of Doris Lessing's The Fifth Child  There are often several themes in fiction books, and this is certainly the case in The Fifth Child. 
To begin with, there is a theme of betrayal running through the entire story. 
Another concept is frequently mentioned, happiness. 
Both these are important ideas, included in the main theme being the struggle between good and evil in various forms.   
Already in the first page there is a sense of David and Harriet defending their individuality against the world. 
They see themselves as old-fashioned and conservative in a positive sense, while being looked upon as timid, abstemious and freaks by their friends and fellow-workers. 
They stubbornly cling to what they feel is good. 
"It had been hard preserving their belief in themselves when the spirit of the time, the greedy and selfish sixties, had been so ready to condemn them..." 
(29) Here is an indication that time is of importance to the story. 
The sixties was a period of women's liberation, family was considered less urgent than a good profession. 
The opinion that women should stay at home caring for the family was regarded old-fashioned. 
David and Harriet were strong believers in family and domestic happiness, and were both determined that Harriet would quit working and be a housewife once the children were born. 
Completely opposite the ideas of the time.  
They buy an enormous Victorian house which becomes their fortress of love and happiness. 
A sacred place tributing family. 
Meanwhile violence, chaos, and wars consume the rest of the world. 
"Outside this fortunate place, their family, beat and battered the storms of the world." 
(29) The large house, referred to as their kingdom, serves as a shield against all evil. 
Safely locked in, the young family and all the relatives can escape from everything but domestic problems, which are light at first. 
"...their kingdom...where so many people came to immerse themselves in safety, comfort, kindness." 
(30) The house itself is described vividly, giving us a taste of the joyousness: the overgrown garden, the lilac tree, the three stories, and the spacious living room with its huge dining table. 
All very suitable for a large fortunate and joyful family.  
The Lovatts are determined to have lots of children at once, despite protests and warnings from their relatives. 
Fortunately, the first four babies turn out to be healthy, lively and, most important, normal. 
The idyllic family dream seems to be fulfilled until the fifth child is born (Ben, the monster. 
He casts a "sickly and implacable shadow" over the family happiness. 
The contrasts between the beautiful, joyful older children and the ugly, fighting creature Ben are striking. 
"From the high skylight fell a distorted rectangle of light, and in it stood Ben...then she saw the Ben that this life he had to lead had subdued: in one leap he had reached the dark edges of the eaves and vanished." 
(140) Ben is often pictured in the shade, in contrast of the other children described playing in the garden. 
The first being symbols of goodness, and the latter a demon of destruction. 
The fortress is eventually destroyed, not by the dangers of the outside world, but by an insider. 
However, there are two ways of looking at this. 
Ben did grow in Harriet's womb, but she repeatedly claims that he fought and willed himself into the world. 
Furthermore, all children but Ben were born in the house, and Lessing seems to be making a point out of it. 
Perhaps Harriet, who felt the maliciousness, did not want to give birth to him in the house in case he would somehow infect it. 
So maybe evil did lurk itself in from the outside after all.   
Are there really any protections from evil and misfortune? 
Harriet and David refer to happiness as something you can choose. 
When Harriet's sister Sarah gives birth to a child with Down's syndrome, Harriet says that "Sarah and William's unhappiness, their quarrelling, had probably attracted the mongol child..." 
(29) In other words that misery attracts evil. 
"The Lowatts were a happy family. 
It was what they had chosen and what they deserved." 
(28) Later we realise that this chosen happiness is not lasting. 
Harriet is bitter and feels betrayed by every one including David. 
Not even outsiders like doctors and teachers acknowledge what they all know is true, Ben being the remains of an ancient species. 
David feels betrayed by Harriet: "He felt...that she was breaking the rules of some contract between them: tears and misery had never been on their agenda!" 
(45) There was now a pointed wedge between them. 
Evil had conquered.   
I believe setting is both important and not very essential at the same time in The Fifth Child. 
It is important when it comes to a few subthemes, the opposing views on family life during this period and the lack of help from the authorities as two examples. 
Nevertheless, I find it redundant to a lot of the remaining themes: the war between good and evil, the pursuance of happiness and how there is no protection against affliction. 
These could all be set in another world, another time, and still make perfect sense. 
Good and evil, joy and pain are universal, we all know what they involve.
