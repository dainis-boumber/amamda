 HOW TO KILL A DICTATOR.  
The lines from this specific scene, Act II, Scene i, takes place at early morning in Brutus' house when Cassius and the other conspirators has come to pay Brutus a visit and see if he has agreed to join their plot to murder Caesar, whom, in their eyes, have grown too powerful and dangerous. 
Brutus have earlier shown some sympathy to the idea and after a great deal of contemplation with himself, he has come to the conclusion that it is best for the common good if Caesar would die. 	 
What I see as the most striking features in this scene is the obvious differences between how Cassius and Brutus thinks when they are approaching the actual deed. 
Cassius is the strategic tactic, who is interested in practical details surrounding the murder. 
First of all, he wants the conspirators to swear an oath to establish a bond between the men, a kind of brotherhood (line 113). 
Secondly, he also wants the conspirators to seek mighty allies that are respected amongst the citizens to justify the deed (lines 141-142) and finally, he is concerned about the aftermath, who will pose a threat to the conspirators after the murder? 
Will some powerful friends of Caesar seek revenge? 
For that reason, Cassius also wants Mark Anthony out of the way (lines 155-161). 
Here we see a rational man who seems to think of the assassination as inevitable, something he is forced to do for the common good. 
He is concerned mainly with the success of the plot and leaves little attention to the fact that they are actually planning to kill a man. 
Infact, he is also prepared to kill other men as well if it benefits the conspiration. 	 
Brutus, on the other hand, is more of a dreamer. 
He doesn't share Cassius burning hatred for Ceasar, and as he sees himself as a man of great morals and dignity he is more concerned with what is right or wrong morally, rather than tactically. 
Brutus seems to regret that he is forced to kill a noble countryman for the general good of the country, and he doesn't want his good name and reputation to be marred with any dishonourable deeds. 
The difference between the two men can be found in the passage where Cassius wants the men to swear an oath to kill Caesar, Brutus says in line 112 "Give me your hands all over, one by one", and Cassius automaticly fills in "And let us swear our resolution". 
Brutus immediately begins a long tirade stating that it will be much more honourable not to swear an oath. 	 
No, not an oath ... 	 ... 
What other bond 	 Than secret Romans that have spoke the word 	 And will not palter? 
And what other oath 	 Than honesty to honesty engaged 	 That this shall be, or we will fall for it? 	 
After Brutus rather pompous monolouge about honesty is over, Cassius do not even care to reply, he simply goes on to the next subject on the agenda, that about allies: "But what about Cicero? 
Shall we sound him?". 
Obviously, Cassius, being pragmatic politician, understands that in order to win Brutus over he must compromise with details. 
Cassius' fellow conspirators Casca, Cinna and Metellus first agrees that it is wise to try to get Cicero on their side, but when Brutus rejects the idea, Cassius is forced to submit once again, and he directly replies: "Then leave him out". 
To that Casca replies: "Indeed he is not fit", whereas only seconds before having said: "Let us not leave him out". 
This passage shows not only that Cassius is willing to compromise quite a lot to get Brutus on his side but also why he is willing to let Brutus have his way. 
People hold Brutus in high regards and they are listening to what he has to say, without him Cassius' plan will have no credibility amongst the public. 	 
The next issue, raised by Decius in line 154, is wether they shall only murder Caesar. 
Here Cassius is more unwilling to compromise, and he is supposedly forced to speak for his beliefs. 	 
Decius, well urged. 
I think it is not meet 	 Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, 	 Should outlive Caesar. 
We shall find of him 	 A shrewed contriver; and you know his means, 	 If he improve them, may well stretch so far 	 As to annoy us all; which to prevent, 	 Let Antony and Caesar fall together. 
Yet again Brutus refuses to listen to reason, and makes another long tirade about the need to act honourably and galantly, this time he outshines himself with pretentious words about their mission, as he obviously sees the killing, "We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood.", "Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.", etc. 
However, this time Cassius will not bend as easily, and for the first time he, at least openly, disagree with Brutus but in the end he is yet again forced to submit. 
Mark Antony will not be killed, that would be dishonourable. 	 
So, what I see as most important in this passage is the fact that the conspirators decide not only to murder Caesar but also that they decide not to murder Mark Antony. 
Furthermore, later in the play Brutus again makes another crucial mistake, that to let Mark Antony speak to the people after the murder. 
Obviously, Cassius is a far better judge of personalities than Brutus and that is really well showed in the passage I have chosen. 
As I mentioned earlier, Cassius might be a much greater politician than Brutus, but Brutus is regarded as a much greater man by the common Roman. 
This passage also shows the difference between the two men very well, Cassius wants action, well planned action. 
Brutus on the other hand believes that a deed wrapped up in noble words automaticly makes the deed noble, he believes that he is a truly honourable man and that makes him always right, even if he has misinterpreted the situation completely. 
That is his weakness, and that is what makes their coup a failure in the end.
