 Who are responsible?  
Today there are a lot of violence on TV, and it influences children as well as everything else that is shown. 
The big problem is that children can not see the difference between reality and the imaginative world on TV. 
The question is who is responsible for protecting the children from all violence?  
There are a lot of violent films, like Terminator, but as a matter of fact shows like the Simpson's and even children's program's, like Tom and Jerry, contains lots of violence. 
The problem is that even if all children's program's got rid of the violence and the parents kept their children from watching violent films, the children would still receive violence from other TV shows. 
The point is that news and sport shows contains violence, and often in a more harsh and brutal form. 
One could wonder what the difference is between news about the war in Bosnia or brutal murders and a movie like Terminator. 
And when professional boxers and wrestlers are getting paid to fight and hurt each other on TV, what are the children supposed to think?  
In the article Locking out violence, by Gina Bellafante, a so called V chip is discussed. 
The V chip is supposed to lock out violence from peoples TVs. 
This may be a good solution for those parents that does not want their children to get influenced by the violence on TV. 
The problem is that if all families in a country do not get the V chip, the children will still be influenced by other children's and there will not be much use in getting the V chip. 
One thing that may help is if all parents talked more with their children and explained the difference between TV and the real world. 
Some parents may not know how to talk with their children about this, but then a psychiatrist could help. 
If I look back on my own childhood, we also watched Tom and Jerry and violent films. 
Still there was not many violent children around. 
The difference could either be the pedagogical approach among the child-minders at the day nurseries and in some of the children's programs, or that our parents talked more with us than today's parents do. 
The stress and the hurry are taking over the society, and this must reflect on the children. 
Maybe it is the lack of tenderness and love that leads to violence. 
This could be proved, looking at the youths that are members of gangs today. 
Most of them have not got a very good childhood. 
Parents should not be allowed to forget their children in this stressed society, but take care of them anyway.  
It is not obvious that this is a parental responsibility though. 
Many parents are helpless towards the great quantity of violence that is pouring in and affects their children. 
Besides the violent films and TV shows, the toy shops are filled with figures and heroes from violent TV shows. 
And, as if this were not enough, children plays Nintendo and different computer games that often is about killing or avoid being killed. 
It is hard for parents to protect their children from all those influences, and it is even harder if not all parents at least tries to talk to their children. 
The V chip maybe works on the violent TV shows, but what about everything else?  
The society in general has to take more responsibility towards this violence problem. 
The government, for example, should set up more rules or suggestions about how to deal with the violent among children. 
If there were more resources for children, like youth recreation centres were the children can use their spare time for something more creative than computer games, the violence may not be that widely spread any more. 
Today there are not much activities for youths and that might be one of the reasons why children spends their spare time indoors and with their computers.  
Finally, no one is to blame for the violence in the society but the society itself. 
Parents should, of course, do their best and talk to their children or maybe even get a V chip. 
The government could control toys and children's program's better and gain the resources for youths and children. 
The violence in the society is probably just a result of the stress we are living in, and the only good thing to do is to take it more easy and think about how we affect our children.
