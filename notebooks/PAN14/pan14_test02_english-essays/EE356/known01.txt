 Evaluation  So, I'm supposed to evaluate my skills in the English language? 
And while I evaluate my skills in this essay, you, my personal tutor, will evaluate my writing skills, which I'm asked to evaluate. 
I didn't know that English teachers had a sense of humour.  	 
You have asked me to evaluate my listening, reading, speaking and writing skills, so I have chosen to divide this essay into four parts, evaluating one skill per part.   
Listening I would say that I'm maybe not a good listener, but I understand spoken English very well (there is a slight difference, between to be a good listener and to understand a language, as you certainly are aware of). 
It's a skill that I have obtained, like most Swedish youths, not from travelling to English speaking countries, but from looking at American and British television programs. 
Some words may be unknown to me and I may not understand someone who is speaking about something very technical.   
Reading I mostly read fantasy, a genre where the books mainly are written in English. 
Tired to wait for translations of books I wanted to read, I begun to read them in English instead. 	
I now feel so used to reading English books, that I hardly think about it. 
I pick up a book in the bookstore and just read it, I don't usually reflect on which language I'm currently reading in. 
I often don't bother if I don't understand a word, as long as I understand the context.  	
I guess I have picked up a lot of words from reading English books, mostly nouns and verbs. 
My knowledge of English adjectives is not as great as my knowledge of nouns and verbs. 
I should try to learn more adjectives. 
Writing gets dull without adjectives, doesn't it? 
Speaking In this area I have my weak spots. 
I have never really trained speaking English. 
I consider my pronunciation to be quite good. 
I have some troubles pronouncing longer words, like the word pronunciation (a word that I already have mentioned one time in this part of the essay!). 	 
I don't think that I speak fluently enough, at least I'm not satisfied in that area. 
I occasionally have spoken to American relatives, who where visiting, but that is about all training I have got except in school.   
Writing Do I write much English? 
I'm a member of an e-mail list, where the members write a never-ending story, you could say. 
The members of the list are from all over the world, so the language we write in is English. 
I must confess that I haven't been one of the busiest writers on that list. 
I have written essays in school, so I have got some training there. 
The fact that I read a lot, has also added to my skills as a writer.  	 
Other than that I don't write much English nowadays, though I believe I am a quite good writer. 
(Sometimes I get writer's block though!) 
I can be a bit sloppy sometimes writing 'their' when I should have written 'there' for an example. 
Hopefully I haven't got any of similar faults in this essay. 	
I'm bad at planning my writing. 
I usually start at the top and write to the bottom. 
I usually find a good first sentence and then the writing goes by itself. 
I believe this have to do with that I usually write fiction. 
I have to learn to write in a more scientific way, keeping to the point and learning to argument in a better way. 
I often write for myself not for the reader. 
My last Swedish teacher said that I was getting lazy when I wrote. 
I believe she was right. 
I usually rely on my talent and don't look through what I really have written.  
I hope this warning have reminded me to be careful and give you, my tutor, some idea of my writing skills.
