 Under The Influence Of Television  Television is good for many things but it has also a negative effect on people. 
In this essay I'm going to deal with some essential points about the influence television has on us. 
We are being exposed to more and more television programs and shows every day. 
Children is most influenced by television. 
Not long ago my own childhood took place therefor I remember what effects it had on me as a child. 
The children's programs I used to watch on television were mostly pedagogical and educational. 
Many of the TV programs taught me common sense and how to treat other people. 
Of course television wasn't the only influence I had and I didn't spend more than maybe an hour a day at the most in front of the screen. 
Children nowadays sometimes watch more shows in one day than I did in a week when I was younger. 
The programs they watch are not always that pedagogical and educational as the ones I used to watch. 
Many of the TV programs are filled with violence. 
The only violence I watched was in animated films and was not to be taken seriously. 
Sometimes I see children fighting each other with sticks and other violent equipment in the schoolyard of a school which I pass on my way to the bus stop. 
It frightens me a bit since I can't recall that I or any of my friends hurt each other with weapons when we were in that age, or now for that matter. 
This is because our society has softened, not only when it comes to violence on TV but also sex and drugs etc. featured in films, computer games, cartoon magazines and so on. 
This has a very negative effect on the children and will also have an influence on the future society when the children of today have grown up.  	
As I have said earlier television hasn't only a negative effect on people, it has also good effects especially on children. 
Television can for instance be a very good language teacher. 
When you're young it's more interesting to watch TV than listen to your school teacher. 
Since many TV programs are from English speaking countries children are being taught English unconsciously. 
It's often said that Swedish people are generally very skilled in the English language, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that we hear English daily, especially from television. 
Television also gives us much general knowledge, especially when we are young and curious to find out about new things. 
Television isn't only good for young and curious people. 
It's important for everybody. 
To keep updated about what's going on in the world it is important to take a look at the TV screen now and then. 
One of the most important features television has is the news programs. 
The news are different depending on what news program we watch, so we have to be careful. 
Many news programs are unreliable or unessential. 
It is important to question what the people on television tell us or the pictures they show us, it's important not to be ignorant.  
There are hundreds of TV channels with thousands of programs and shows altogether so many people grow apathetic. 
There are simply to many interesting things on TV so many people tend to get stuck in front of the TV. 
Therefor it is very important to separate what you would like to watch from what is really important to see. 
Zapping between the different channels can be dangerous since it can go on for several hours. 
Hours that could have been spent on work for instance. 
In society today we life fast so it's important not to grow apathetic to keep up with everybody else. 
Nevertheless it's important to relax occasionally to not suffer from too much stress, and there's nothing as relaxing as zapping between the channels on the TV. 
This leaves many people in a dilemma. 
Television has become something not many people can live without in westernized countries. 
It gives us a lot of joy, relaxation and general knowledge among other things. 
Naturally we should use this brilliant invention to make our lives better, but we should also be aware so television doesn't end up guiding our lives instead.
