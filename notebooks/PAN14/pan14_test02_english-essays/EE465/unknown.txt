I really like the English language and I guess that's why I keep trying to get a hang of it. 
If I had listen to some teachers during the years then I guess that I shouldn't be writing this essay. 
I can't say that I'm really great or that I'm proud of my skills in the English language but I usually manage in everyday life with what I can. 
I have a lot of weaknesses and I'm going to tell you about three of these who I think makes me do most mistakes with the language. 
After that I will tell you of what I think is my strength. 	 
The most common situation when I use English is when I speak with some tourists at the hotel where I use to work. 
When I speak it feels like I'm going on a feeling and I know that I make many mistakes. 
One of my main weakness is grammar. 
I have always thought that when it comes to grammar the exceptions are so many more then the real rules. 
Unfortunnaly that is what it has been ending in my mind, like a lot of exceptions. 
The English grammar have many exceptions but they don't disappear just because I try to avoid them, so I have realised. 
Of course this grammar weakness shines through everything that I do. 
I know that during the school years I have been trying to learn grammar but that we haven't done enough exercises to make the rules clear and easy to use. 
This experence I can take and use as a challenge when I one day stands infront of a class of my own. 
How do you teach English grammar in an interesting and easy way? 
For my own sake at this point I feel like the grammar stops me from being as spontaneous as I wish to be. 
My intentions are to try to change some of that with this course.  	 
The second thing that I think of as a weakness is that my vocabulary isn't big enough. 
This gets the effect that when I use the English language to express myself it feels like I only use the same words over and over again. 
And in some situations I can't find the word for what I want to say. 
This is the same for any other language I guess, you always need to learn new words all the time to "grow".  	 
Finally, the third weakness is the pronunciation of the language. 
Since I have never been abroad longer than for a week and during that time never been to USA or Great Britain it feels like I haven't got to practice the language enough. 
I think that one of the important things when it comes to learn pronunciation is to keep talking. 
If you don't talk you can never get to know the mistakes you are doing and correct them.  	 
Of course when I read, write, speak and listen to others the grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation weaknesses are seen but not as clear in all situations. 
To read a book can be very difficult when there are a lot of words that you don't understand. 
When I'm reading, the grammar problem won't be such a big thing and the pronunciation won't be noticed unless I'm reading for someone. 
When I write it's very easy to fall into those grammar traps and use a "speaking language". 
This will the one who reads the written text easily see. 
If I'm talking to someone the grammar and pronunciation is important, but normally I haven't got the time to think about the grammer when I'm speaking. 
If I'm listening to someone I might not understand what he or she is telling me so we might misunderstand each other. 
These are all things that happens to me because of my limitations in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation but they are all things that I can work on.  	 
My strenght I think when it comes to the English language is that I really do want to learn it and that I'm really stubborn and I'm not going to give up until I'm where I want to be. 
This stubborn thing can be a bad thing to be but I figure that if I can use it for something good like in this case it can be a help. 
So at the end my hope is that when I'm where I want to be, I will be able to read, write, speak and listen without feeling the limits that I can do today. 
In another way you might say that I can work as much and as hard as I want to. 
There will still be things that I can learn during my whole lifetime. 
But I wont give up!
