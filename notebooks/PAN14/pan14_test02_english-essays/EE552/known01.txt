At the age of ten, fourth grade, I had English for the first time in school but that was not the first time I had been in touch with the language. 
When I was five my dad bought a book "1000 words in English" to me which I studied carefully for a couple of years. 
I think that book is one of the most valuable book I have ever read in English. 
I learned so many words and yet today I remember the day I learned certain words. 
Even though I had practice my English a few years before I started it in school I didn't consider myself as an over average student. 
I learned that a lot of my classmates was even better then me- a whole lot better.  	
Even at this time, after nine years of English in school and one year in the States, I know my English could be much better. 
I was an average student before my year in America and in my senior year in high school I was among the best in my class. 
I guess people would think I should be better than my classmates since I have had the chance to be in the U.S. 
Of course it easy for me to adjust to the language. 
It only takes me a couple of minutes of listening before I can follow without much difficulties. 
It is always easier to listen than to talk. 
I had no troubles in the American school when the teachers talked. 
I think my friends didn't really understand this. 
They thought since I had difficulties talking it would be the same for me to understand when they spoke. 
So they started to speak v e r y s l o w l y which really annoyed me. 
Then on the other hand I had problems to concentrate cause it took them so long getting it out, what ever they were going to say.
When I watch English movies I usually try only to listen to what they are saying instead of reading the Swedish lines. 
Only if it is not a John Grisham movie, or something similar to that. 
Grisham uses a language of high academic level and it is hard enough to follow the plot. 	
I used to be a very lousy talker. 
I was never confident in talking English in school neither to my friends in class nor my teacher. 
I didn't say much in class, not until my senior year in high school. 
The only time I spoke was when we had speeches and when I read loud out of a book. 
I thought since they know Swedish and so do I, why speak English? 
I felt stupid. 
I had troubles knowing what to say, translate it in my head and get it out in words that didn't come natural for me.
I guess that has been one of my weaknesses through the years in school. 
But luckily now I have been able to change that. 
Today I love talking English, it has become more natural to me. 
I feel more confident about it. 
It might not be perfect grammar but who cares, as long as I dare talk I think that is good. 
I no longer have to translate the words in my mind. 
It comes out more or less fluently. 
Of course it depends on what I am saying.  	
Even writing and reading has become more fluently.
Writing is the same as talking. 
I like to write, but I have troubles with the grammar. 
I think I tend to write "Swenglish". 
Instead of using these special words I have to explain it. 
Also the way I put the words I guess you could tell I am a Swede. 
I am a very slow reader. 
Especially in the beginning of a book. 
I need to know all the words to go on, which is booth good and bad. 
It takes forever to get started but at the other hand I learn new words. 
When I finally has read a few chapter I usually don't look up all the words just the ones that really puzzles me.  	
Drawing a conclusion of all this must be that I love dealing with the English as a language and I tend to work a lot to improve it. 
One thing I really need to work with is the grammar. 
That's a big weakness I have, the one that gives me away.
