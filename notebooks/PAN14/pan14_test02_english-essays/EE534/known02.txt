 The school in our time  People in general have very different opinions about whether the private sector's be or not to be. 
I myself find it very appealing in some areas; especially when it comes to educational matters. 
It is a privileged resource that everyone should appreciate and give a warm welcome. 
Privatization in schools is essential to be able to attain student achievement, based upon their own motivation to learn and interest in their subjects. 
These schools have a curricula that presuppose from the childrens' needs and meet them at their level of development. 
There are a wider selection of subjects that demand a certain imaginative and creative mind; which challenge the children. 
Rewarding challenges that lead to good knowledge to use in the future to come. 	
You can always try to find flowing creativity, motivation and happiness in an unpleasant environment, but most certainly you will not find it. 
A lot of times this is unfortunately a fact when it comes to schools outside the private sector. 
You gather too many children in a much too small room, and call this a classroom. 
In this room the head of the class, that is the teacher, is trying his/her best to give the children a valuable education. 
And that is with far too few books, and other pedagogical material that children need to be able to receive knowledge. 
Comparing to this I should think the private alternative is evident. 
The classrooms are perhaps not larger but the number of children in the same class is not even close to the number of children in Public schools. 
When walking into a classroom in a private school you meet a motivation and creativity that is unfortunally not very common in Public schools. 
You can also be pleased with the fact that all children have their own new books, not old inherited ones. 
That is; when they need books. 
In many subjects in the private schools the children work with other materials, as in biology they use the nature as knowledge resource. 
Their facilities are more modern over all.
Private schools do not just have more modern facilities, than Public scools; they also have more modern, and motivated teachers that are interested of the childrens'best. 
With modern teachers I mean that they a lot of times have attended further educational training. 
This makes them aware of new didactical and pedagogical knowledge. 
It is more rare to find teachers of the same educational experiences in Public schools; mainly because of the economical situation. 
Schools in the private sector are a lot of times sponsored by different kinds of companies; that are providing them with books, computers and other essential facilities. 
These schools therefor have more money to spend on their teachers'further educational training, and other necessities that makes them high-quality schools. 	
Mentioning high-quality scools brings me to think of the differing in grade scales, between Public schools and Private schools. 
The latter, see to that the childrens' personal qualities come to its right. 
Instead of Public schools, where the students receive a piece of paper with the letters: U, G, VG, MVG, the children get their grades described in detail. 
This means that either if you are a high-level student or a low-level student your personal qualities are shown and matter. 
This is an essential difference. 
The students put a lot of hard work and effort in their years of studying and should get shown valuable credit for it. 
This system demand a lot of the children which makes them more motivated and detemined to struggle to get through with good grades. 
People that are more positive to Public schools than to Schools in the private sector might use this utterance as a "weapon" against Private schools. 
They seem to be of the opinion that grades seem to be the most essential aim in these schools and they tend to dislike the demands Private schools have on the children. 
These schools do have demands on the children and they are aiming to get high-level students; but this is also what these children are going to meet in the "real world", outside the protected school. 	
If society wants well-educated, motivated, creative and ambitious students; Private schools are a good educational alternative. 
They provide the children with the best possible didactic and pedagogic models; to suit every student's needs and meet them at their level of development.
