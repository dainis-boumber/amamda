I've always thought that language is pretty difficult. 
To learn a whole new language and to communicate with other people in a new way. 
But you can't say that English is a whole new language. 
You often say something in English everyday. 
The most people do. 
Sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously. 
Because of that you may think that you can learn English very easily. 
But that's not often the case.  
You may be good at speaking and listening but when it comes to the grammar, can you also handle that part? 
Maybe or maybe not. 
However, that's the way I feel about my English. 
But to be sure, I'm going to analyze my knowledge when it comes to English.  
Listening ore often than not I understand most parts of what an Englishspeaking person says. 
And in most cases I do understand what they say on TV (MTV, Discovery). 
To know the meaning of what someone is telling you in English is not that hard for me. 
It's the same thing when I listen to music. 
Just by hearing a song a few times, I can sing the whole song and also know what it means. 
My friends often asks me where I get the lyrics, I just tell them "I just remember the song, that's all". 
And when I don't understand, I can just by watching the person's bodylanguage understand what he or she is trying to tell me. 
But of course, sometimes I just don't understand, despite of the bodylanguage.  
Reading Now, to the more difficult thing, reading. 
Reading has never been "my thing". 
Sure, I can read a Swedish book now and then but it's not something I love to do. 
I'm always so curious about the ending and everything, I just can't wait. 
And with English books it's even harder, so you can see my point here. 
But now I will be much better at reading because of all the English novels we're going to read. 
And I think that the result will be pretty good. 
I mean, I can't get worse, and I'm not that bad. 
So, we'll see.   
Speaking Sometimes speaking can be great fun. 
When you feel that what you're saying actually makes sense. 
But sometimes words, that are normally really easy to say can just be very hard to get out. 
Why does that happen? 
Maybe because in some cases I feel insecure about my English. 
But that depends of course who I'm talking to. 
In any cases, I never feel 100 per cent sure about my Englsih. 
But sometimes everything just flows along.  
Writing It's great fun to write in English. 
You can test yourself. 
What am I really capable of? 
Sometimes everything goes just well and I feel secure about my performance in a test, for example. 
I often trust my intuition. 
If it feels right, then it's right. 
But then I may discover some errors.  
But sometimes most parts are right. 
There are times when phrases that I normally don't use, become familiar. 
It can be something I've heard on TV or somewhere else, just some expressions that I catch up. 
These things happen more often when I write, if I compare with my speaking. 
And I've always loved writing.  
To write something in English can in some cases feel better than writing in Swedish.   
English will always be something exciting for me. 
I hope someday to be able to speak fluent English. 
I have plans to move to the United States, and hopefully I will have some great English experiences when I get home.
