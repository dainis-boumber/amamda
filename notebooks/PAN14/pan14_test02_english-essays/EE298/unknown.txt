 What have happened to today's younger children  I believe younger children of today are more violent and brutal when playing and fighting with eachother as compared to when I was a child. 
They play combat and fighting games with lots of kicking and punching. 
What they do not know is that they attack on sensitive places such as skull, face and knees. 
Do they not know it is dangerous and harmful? 
Why has the view to violence changed?  
One major bad influence factor is the TV. 
Kids are spend more time in front of the TV sets than when I was a kid. 
It comes with the technology. 
Unfortunatly, most of today's TV programs are not suitable to be watched by children alone and some would actually need parental guidence. 
There are too much excessive violence and deaths showing. 
Even the children programs are not too child friendly. 
Cartoons for example, are mostly imported from either USA or Japan. 
I would say in general, all Disney programs from USA are childfriendly but those from Japan bring storylines such as weak vs strong, poor vs rich and good vs evil. 
These contrasts are very often emphasised to its extreme and younger kids that watch these programs, who do not know any better, apply these happenings or situations to themselves and starts mistreating or suppress other kids due to the reason they being poor or weak. 
When I was a child, I watched cartoons such as 'Donald Duck and his friends' or child program such as 'Beppe Wolgers'. 
Where did those innocent programs go? 
Another major bad influence comes from another techology devise, the computer games. 
I believe most kid of today have some been exposed to the vast variety of different computer games. 
To win you have to somehow eliminate all the players by either fighting or shooting them down. 
What happened to all those 'Pac Man' games? 
Factors such as the movies are also a source of showing excessive violence and action. 
Violent scenes and happenings are almost being glorified and exposed to the audience with such a positive and remarkable power and conviction. 
Many of which these actions had not been able to be made if not because of these high-tech equipments. 
This is what movie makers call to be 'realistic and convincing' and have as a goal when making action movies. 
There is also news, with the help of the massmedia, is another example of one of these programs that shows too much violence. 
In today's world there excist too many conflicts and struggles between different peoples and countries. 
Many times these struggles result in war and fighting. 
This is the headlines of today's international news while the local news exposes crimes such as armed robberies and assult and battery. 
What kind of world do we live in?  
But then, why is it that younger kids spends so much time by the TV? 
They should be out doing some extra-curriculum after-school activity or maybe even some activities with the family. 
Many would say that it is due to change of society and the value of living. 
Parents of today all need to work to afford their high standard of living and automaticly do not have time for their kids. 
I know that in reality, many parents thinks TV as a good alternative for baby sitting where the TV also could occupy them for a longer period of time. 
Parents are somewhat to be blamed for since they are pushing aside their parental responsibility when not activating their children. 
If in any case this would be necessarily, to put your kids infront of the TV, there should be some restrictions on what they watch. 
Either to make sure the program does not contain too much violence or maybe watch it together to guide them through with explanations.  
With the ravaging pace of new high technology effecting and in many cases, improving our daily life, automatically brings higher living standards for many of us but it will also contribute to the negligence in the upbring of today's younger children by irresponsible parents. 
To keep a well functioned, active and close family social bond will make a lot different in the upbring of a child, both socially and physicially.
