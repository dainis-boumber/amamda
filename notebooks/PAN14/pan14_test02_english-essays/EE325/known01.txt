 Evaluation  I have always got the highest mark in English, but that is not mainly because I am good at English. 
I believe that is has more to do with my Swedish. 
I love my language, to express myself and to write essays. 
Then I just translate it and the English teacher will be happy. 
I have often had it easier then classmates grown up in English speaking families, though my vocabulary is quite small. 
I can quickly find another way of saying what I want, or more often, I say something else. 
I think that this is what I need to work with, because it is rather painful when someone says -Is that really so? 
And I can only say -Well, it's not, but it sounded very good, don't you think? 
Accordingly, I need to expand my vocabulary to be able to say what I want, but I still must keep my fancy of well sounding words and texts, because that makes me want to learn English, I think it is such a beautiful language.  	
As I said, I like writing. 
I write some poetry and articles and things like that, but mostly in Swedish of course. 
It helps me a lot when writing in English to know about the writing process, how to strucure, and most important that I enjoy writing and do not get tired of it. 
But still, it is not at all the same thing as writing in Swedish. 
I haven't got any language of my own in English. 
I just use the common school words and frases, they not really alive and I am not confident enough to play around with them. 
Once again, I need more words, I want to be able to vary my language. 
Writning this essay, I have also noticed that I am often unsure about which prepositions to use. 
I guess the solution is just to write and to read.  	
I do read a lot, but not very much in English. 
I find it very annoying having to interupt my reading all the time to look up words. 
I know that I should not stop at every single word that I don't know, but on the other hand I read in English to learn new words. 
It feels a bit like I am making up problems that did not exist before I started writing this, but since I have to produce sevenhundred words, I'll just go on.  	
I'll go on to discuss my speaking, which is not always fluent, because the words tend to disappear when I need them. 
It is probably just a matter of talking and talking to get over it. 
And that is what I have done during this summer, since I went with a biketour containing people from all over Europe. 
I learned a lot of bike terms: spokes, luggage carrier, flat tyre and so on, but also more important things. 
It came very natural to go on speaking, just to make myself understood, though it was not all grammaticly correct. 
That is usually checking me, making me think for a while before I say something, but it is easier to relax among people with other mother tongues than English. 
Luckily, there were also some native speakers to ask. 
I believe that these circumstances were perfect for learning, compared to for instance the language journey I went with, some five years ago.  	
There is now one skill left, which is often forgotten at school, and that is listening. 
It is tested in the national exams, but hardly ever practiced actively. 
I don't think it is a problem for Swedes, since most people watch a lot of English television, but I don't. 
Anyhow I have had good results in those exams, maybe it has something to do with Momo. 
Momo is a girl who is good at nothing else than listening, but this skill makes her very needed and it gets her into wondersome adventures. 
Ever since I read the book about her, by Michael Ende, I have tried to become a good listener and I think I am at least better than before, both in English and Swedish. 
I am planning to improve my listening during this fall, both because there are a lot of lectures to listen to during this course, and because I work some hours each week as a personal assistent for a girl who likes to watch American talkshows. 	
Well, that is something about me. 
Not all of me, but the whole story would need more than sevenhundred words.
