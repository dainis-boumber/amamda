I still remember when I first met the language in school. 
It was in the third class and we had to choose an English name and an English city. 
So I changed identity and become "Kate from Liverpool". 
It was a funny way to make children interested in English. 
I have studied the language for 10 years and it has been very interesting but sometimes very hard. 
I will assess my strengths and weaknesses in the English language in the four skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. 
At the end I will make a summary of my thoughts.  
Listening Since I was a little girl I have listened to the English language on radio and TV. 
I love watching British TV-programmes and I'm also a big fan of British music. 
So my strength is that I have always listened to the language and when I like to do something it is easier to understand.  
When I watch TV I can always look at the text-screen if I don't understand a special word. 
But now when I take part in English lectures, I often find it hard to understand everything because there are so many special expressions that I have never heard of before. 
I hung up on these expressions and forget to go on listening. 
Therefore I'm going to write these words down at once and later when I got time I will check them and try to learn them. 
In that way I will get rid of my weakness of hunging up on special words.   
Reading  I have not read many books in English. 
It depends on that it takes so long time for me because I always have to check every word which I don't understand. 
But I have promised myself to read more since I have been told that it is very useful reading literature when you want to improve in a foreign language.   y strength is that I usually read books, in Swedish though, which are originally written by authors from Britain. 
Especially I like reading detective-stories of Agatha Christie, Elisabeth George and P.D James. 
These books are very detailed and I therefore learn how British people think and act and also how the society works. 
(Of course are not all Britons murderers. 
Some of them are actually policemen).  
Speaking Unfortunately I have not got the opportunity to live abroad and I have therefore not been able practising the English language. 
Occasionally I have spent some weeks in English-talking countries but I have felt very insure of my ability of speaking English. 
Of course after a few pints I can speak quite well because I feel more comfortable and relaxed. 
But I can't go on drinking beer every time I want my English to flow.  
Though, speaking English is my biggest weakness. 
I feel uncomfortable when I don't find the right words and expressions. 
I also want to learn more slang-words so I can speak in a more "easy" way.  
Writing Writing essays are not my strength neither in Swedish nor in English. 
I have difficulties in expressing myself correctly and I need to be more creative when I write essays.  
Anyhow I think I'm very good at spelling. 
My teachers have always claimed that it is very important so I have tried to spend much time learning how to spell. 
Therefore it is a pity (of course it is good) when you nowadays can check the spelling by help from the spelling-controller in your computer.  
Summary y weaknesses in the English language partly depend on that I have never been able to practice the language abroad. 
Therefore I'm not good at speaking English and I find difficulties in knowing special expressions and words. 
I have always thought that writing is boring because I think it is hard to express myself.  y strengths are that I'm good at spelling. 
I have also a quite big knowledge in the British society since I have read a lot of English literatures and I have watched many British TV-programmes. 
I'm really looking forward to improving English, my English! 
And I think it will be very fascinating to go to England in autumn.
