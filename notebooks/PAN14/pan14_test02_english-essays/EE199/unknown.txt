After studying English for about nine years I was given the task to evaluate my weaknesses and strengths in the English language. 
I questioned myself; do I understand everything I hear, can I talk about everything I want to, do I have to use the dictionary every time I read or write in English? 
In this essay I will focus on these four diverse skills and my competence in each one of them. 
Soon I realized that this was something I had never thought about. 
Maybe because learning English never felt like a necessary evil to me, on the contrary I enjoyed every new word I wrote down in my notebook. 
My favorite game as a child was actually playing the Cosby show. 
I acted the role of Mrs. 
Huxtable and my English consisted of the words yes, please, twelve and bicycle. 
Hopefully I've improved my knowledge dramatically since then. 
Most definitely, these early approaches to the language formed my future interest in it. 	 
Though I very much like writing in English I would consider my ability as rather poor. 
Probably owing to lack of practice. 
We didn't do much writing in school. 
Neither did we study much grammar, which I at that time found like a relief and today regret deeply. 
The more I've learnt English the more I've seen the importance of a steady grammar-base. 
In daily speech, grammar isn't really given a thought, but in writing it is so obvious when you make a mistake. 
This is the skill in English that I apparently have to spend most time on.  	 
Although grammar is easier in oral communication I sometimes still make mistakes. 
Just two months ago, on the plane to New York, I addressed one of the flight attendants a waitress instead of a stewardess. 
Off course she gave me a look of insult and I apologized her with a typical Swedish smile and a silent sorry. 
I know I have to relax more and accept minor errors to amend my speech and myself. 
Because I like to speak and I wish I wouldn't feel intimidated when giving speeches or talking in large groups.  	 
I feel much more confident about my reading competence. 
This was something I got to practice a lot at school and also at home reading magazines and searching the Internet for essay material. 
Occasionally I read the texts aloud, which my dear brother didn't find very amusing. 
However I feel like this helped me a lot. 
To actually listen to my voice and play with it. 
I did everything from Tom Cleese British to Dolly Parton American. 
Finally I'd learned a lot of the words I'd read and at the same time I'd found my own English voice.  	 
Presumably my spoken English is a blend of all the English-speaking people I've met. 
Many of the different accents I've heard were quite difficult to understand. 
For example last summer I happened to meet some Welshmen and we had great troubles communicating. 
I almost started to doubt what I learned in school when I hardly caught a word they said.  
On the other hand English without Welsh accent is easy to understand. 
I listen and I don't think about that it is not my mother tongue. 
When I watch a movie I try not to read the subtitle. 
This not only to practice my comprehension but also for the reason there are much more in a dialogue than just words, it is how you say them, the intonation, and the meaning of the word in specific contexts.  	 
To sum up this essay about my knowledge and proficiency in the English language I would say I still have a lot to learn. 
I know now which particular parts I have to improve, writing and speaking. 
I've already started, right now, with this essay. 
As to my oral fluency I should try to appear more in class and grasp every opportunity to speak English. 
Finally, I understand almost everything I hear, I can't really talk about everything I want to, I sometimes have to use the dictionary when I read or write. 
But I'm working on it.
