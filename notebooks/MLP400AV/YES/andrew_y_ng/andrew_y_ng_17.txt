Abstract. This paper describes a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and local-
ization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of determining the location of environmen-
tal features with a roving robot. Many of todays popular techniques are based on extended
Kalman lters (EKFs), which require update time quadratic in the number of features in the
map. This paper develops the notion of sparse extended information lters (SEIFs), as a new
method for solving the SLAM problem. SEIFs exploit structure inherent in the SLAM prob-
lem, representing maps through local, Web-like networks of features. By doing so, updates
can be performed in constant time, irrespective of the number of features in the map. This
paper presents several original constant-time results of SEIFs, and provides simulation results
that show the high accuracy of the resulting maps in comparison to the computationally more
cumbersome EKF solution.

1 Introduction
The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem is the problem of ac-
quiring a map of an unknown environment with a moving robot, while simultane-
ously localizing the robot relative to this map [6,12]. The SLAM problem addresses
situations where the robot lacks a global positioning sensor, and instead has to rely
on a sensor of incremental ego-motion for robot position estimation (e.g., odometry,
inertial navigation). Such sensors accumulate error over time, making the problem
of acquiring an accurate map a challenging one. Within mobile robotics, the SLAM
problem is often referred to as one of the most challenging ones [31].

In recent years, the SLAM problem has received considerable attention by the
scientic community, and a urry of new algorithms and techniques has emerged, as
attested, for example, by a recent workshop on this topic [11]. Existing algorithms
can be subdivided into batch and online techniques. The former provide sophisti-
cated techniques to cope with perceptual ambiguities [2,26,34], but they can only
generate maps after extensive batch processing. Online techniques are specically
suited to acquire maps as the robot navigates [6,29], which is of great practical im-
portance in many navigation and exploration problems [27]. Todays most widely
used online algorithms are based on extended Kalman lters (EKFs), based on a
seminal series of papers [19,29,28]. EKFs calculate Gaussian posteriors over the
locations of environmental features and the robot itself.

A key bottleneck of EKFswhich has been subject to intense researchis their
computational complexity. The standard EKF approach requires time quadratic in
the number of features in the map, for each incremental update. This computational
burden restricts EKFs to relatively sparse maps with no more than a few hundred
features. Recently, several researchers have developed hierarchical techniques that
decompose maps into collections of smaller, more manageable submaps [1,8,35].
While in principle, hierarchical techniques can solve this problem in linear time,
many of these techniques still require quadratic time per update. One recent tech-
nique updates the estimate in constant time [13] by restricting all computation to the
submap in which the robot presently operates. Using approximation techniques for
transitioning between submaps, this work demonstrated that consistent error bounds
can be maintained with a constant-time algorithm. However, the method does not
propagate information to previously visited submaps unless the robot subsequently
revisits these regions. Hence, this method suffers a slower rate of convergence in
comparison to the O(N 2) full covariance solution. Alternative methods based on de-
composition into submaps, such as the sequential map joining techniques described
in [30,36] can achieve the same rate of convergence as the full EKF solution, but in-
cur a O(n2) computational burden. A different line of research has relied on particle
lters for efcient mapping [7]. The FastSLAM algorithm [18] and related mapping
algorithms [20] require time logarithmic in the number of features in the map, but
they depend linearly on a particle-lter specic parameter (the number of particles),
whose scaling with environmental size is still poorly understood. None of these ap-
proaches, however, offer constant time updating while simultaneously maintaining
global consistency of the map. More recently (and motivated by this paper), thin
junction trees have been applied to the SLAM problem by Paskin [25]. This work
establishes a viable alternative to the approach proposed here, with somewhat dif-
ferent computational properties.

This paper proposes a new SLAM algorithm whose updates require constant
time, independent of the number of features in the map. Our approach is based on
the well-known information form of the EKF, also known as the extended informa-
tion lter (EIF) [23]. To achieve constant time updating, we develop an approximate
EIF which maintains a sparse representation of environmental dependencies. Em-
pirical simulation results provide evidence that the resulting maps are comparable
in accuracy to the computationally much more cumbersome EKF solution, which is
still at the core of most work in the eld.

Our approach is best motivated by investigating the workings of the EKF. Fig-
ure 1 shows the result of EKF mapping in an environment with 50 landmarks. The
left panel shows a moving robot, along with its Gaussian estimates of the location
of all 50 point features. The central information maintained by the EKF solution is a
covariance matrix of these different estimates. The normalized covariance, i.e., the
correlation, is visualized in the center panel of this gure. Each of the two axes lists
the robot pose (x-y location and orientation) followed by the x-y-locations of the
50 landmarks. Dark entries indicate strong correlations. It is known that in the limit
of SLAM, all x-coordinates and all y-coordinates become fully correlated [6]. The
checkerboard appearance of the correlation matrix illustrates this fact. Maintain-
ing these cross-correlationsof which there are quadratically many in the number

of features in the mapare essential to the SLAM problem. This observation has
given rise to the (false) suspicion that online SLAM is inherently quadratic in the
number of features in the map.

The key insight that motivates our approach is shown in the right panel of Fig-
ure 1. Shown there is the inverse covariance matrix (also known as information
matrix [17,23]), normalized just like the correlation matrix. Elements in this nor-
malized information matrix can be thought of as constraints, or links, between the
locations of different features: The darker an entry in the display, the stronger the
link. As this depiction suggests, the normalized information matrix appears to be
naturally sparse: it is dominated by a small number of strong links, and possesses a
large number of links whose values, when normalized, are near zero. Furthermore,
link strength is related to distance of features: Strong links are found only between
geometrically nearby features. The more distant two landmarks, the weaker their
link. This observation suggest that the EKF solution to SLAM possesses important
structure that can be exploited for more efcient solutions. While any two features
are fully correlated in the limit, the correlation arises mainly through a network of
local links, which only connect nearby landmarks.

Our approach exploits this structure by maintaining a sparse information ma-
trix, in which only nearby features are linked through a non-zero element. The re-
sulting network structure is illustrated in the right panel of Figure 2, where disks
corresponds to point features and dashed arcs to links, as specied in the infor-
mation matrix visualized on the left. Shown also is the robot, which is linked to a
small subset of all features only, called active features and drawn in black. Storing
a sparse information matrix requires linear space. More importantly, updates can be
performed in constant time, regardless of the number of features in the map. The
resulting lter is a sparse extended information lter, or SEIF. We show empiri-
cally that the SEIFs tightly approximate conventional extended information lters,
which previously applied to SLAM problems in [21,23] and which are functionally
equivalent to the popular EKF solution.

Our technique is probably most closely related to work on SLAM lters that
represent relative distances, such as Newmans geometric projection lter [24] and
extensions [5], and Csorbas relative lter [4]. It is also highly related to prior work

of our constant time solution.

by Lu and Milion [15], who use poses as basic state variables in SLAM, between
which they dene local constraints obtained via scam matching. The locality of
these constraints is similar to the local constraints in SEIFs, despite the fact that
Lu and Milios do not formulate their lter in the information form. The problem
of calculating posterior over paths is that both the computation and the memory
grows with the path length, even in environments of limited size. It appears fea-
sible to condense this information by subsuming multiple traversals of the same
area into a single variable. We suspect that such a step would be aproximate, and
that it would require similar approximations as proposed in this paper. At present,
neither of these approaches permit constant time updating in SLAM, even though
it appears that several of these techniques could be developed into constant time
algorithms. Our work is also related to the rich body of literature on topological
mapping [3,10,16,37], which typically does not explicitly represent dependencies
and correlations in the representation of uncertainty. One can view SEIFs as a repre-
sentation of local relative information between nearby landmarks; a feature shared
by many topological approaches to mapping.

2 Extended Information Filters

This section reviews the extended information lter (EIF), which forms the basis of
our work. EIFs are computationally equivalent to extended Kalman lters (EKFs),
but they represent information differently: instead of maintaining a covariance ma-
trix, the EIF maintains an inverse covariance matrix, also known as information
matrix. EIFs have previously been applied to the SLAM problem, most notably by
Nettleton and colleagues [21,23], but they are much less common than the EKF
approach.

Most of the material in this section applies equally to linear and non-linear l-
ters. We have chosen to present all material in the extended, non-linear form, since
robots are inherently non-linear.

2.1 Information Form of the SLAM Problem
Let xt denote the pose of the robot at time t. For rigid mobile robots operating in
a planar environment, the pose is given by its two Cartesian coordinates and the
robots heading direction. Let N denote the number of features (e.g., landmarks) in
the environment. The variable yn with 1 (cid:20) n (cid:20) N denotes the pose of the n-th
feature. For example, for point landmarks in the plane, yn may comprise the two-
dimensional Cartesian coordinates of this landmark. In SLAM, it is usually assumed
that features do not change their pose (or location) over time.

The robot pose xt and the set of all feature locations Y together constitute the

state of the environment. It will be denoted by the vector (cid:24)t = (cid:0) xt y1 : : : yN(cid:1)T ,

where the superscript T refers to the transpose of a vector.

In the SLAM problem, it is impossible to sense the state (cid:24)t directlyotherwise
there would be no mapping problem. Instead, the robot seeks to recover a proba-
bilistic estimate of (cid:24)t. Written in a Bayesian form, our goal shall be to calculate a
posterior distribution over the state (cid:24)t. This posterior p((cid:24)t j zt; ut) is conditioned on
past sensor measurements zt = z1; : : : ; zt and past controls ut = u1; : : : ; ut. Sen-
sor measurements zt might, for example, specify the approximate range and bearing
to nearby features. Controls ut specify the robot motion command asserted in the
time interval (t (cid:0) 1; t].
Following the rich EKF tradition in the SLAM literature, our approach repre-
sents the posterior p((cid:24)t j zt; ut) by a multivariate Gaussian distribution over the
state (cid:24)t. The mean of this distribution will be denoted (cid:22)t, and covariance matrix (cid:6)t:

(1)

p((cid:24)t j zt; ut) / exp(cid:8)(cid:0) 1

2 ((cid:24)t (cid:0) (cid:22)t)T (cid:6)(cid:0)1

t

((cid:24)t (cid:0) (cid:22)t)(cid:9)

The proportionality sign replaces a constant normalizer that is easily recovered from
the covariance (cid:6)t. The representation of the posterior via the mean (cid:22)t and the co-
variance matrix (cid:6)t is the basis of the EKF solution to the SLAM problem (and to
EKFs in general).

Information lters represent the same posterior through a so-called information
matrix Ht and an information vector btinstead of (cid:22)t and (cid:6)t. These are obtained
by multiplying out the exponent of (1):

2 (cid:24)T

t (cid:6)(cid:0)1
t (cid:6)(cid:0)1

t (cid:24)t (cid:0) 2(cid:22)T
t (cid:6)(cid:0)1
t (cid:24)t + (cid:22)T

t (cid:22)t(cid:3)(cid:9)
= exp(cid:8)(cid:0) 1
2(cid:2)(cid:24)T
= exp(cid:8)(cid:0) 1
t (cid:22)t(cid:9)
We now observe that the last term in the exponent, (cid:0) 1
t (cid:22)t does not contain
the free variable (cid:24)t and hence can be subsumed into the constant normalizer. This
gives us the form:

t (cid:6)(cid:0)1
t (cid:24)t (cid:0) 1

t (cid:24)t + (cid:22)T
2 (cid:22)T

t (cid:6)(cid:0)1

The information matrix Ht and the information vector bt are now dened as indi-

and

bt = (cid:22)T

Using these notations, the desired posterior can now be represented in what is com-
monly known as the information form of the Kalman lter:

p((cid:24)t j zt; ut) / exp(cid:8)(cid:0) 1

2 (cid:24)T

t Ht(cid:24)t + bt(cid:24)t(cid:9)

As the reader may easily notice, both representations of the multi-variate Gaus-
sian posterior are functionally equivalent (with the exception of certain degenerate
cases): The EKF representation of the mean (cid:22)t and covariance (cid:6)t, and the EIF
representation of the information vector bt and the information matrix Ht. In partic-
ular, the EKF representation can be recovered from the information form via the
following algebra:

(cid:6)t = H(cid:0)1

t

and

(cid:22)t = H(cid:0)1

t bT

t = (cid:6)tbT
t

(6)

The advantage of the EIF over the EKF will become apparent further below, when
the concept of sparse EIFs will be introduced.

Of particular interest will be the geometry of the information matrix. This matrix

is symmetric and positive-denite:

Each element in the information matrix constraints one (on the main diagonal) or
two (off the main diagonal) elements in the state vector. We will refer to the off-
diagonal elements as links: the matrices Hxt;yn link together the robot pose estimate
for n 6= n0
and the location estimate of a specic feature, and the matrices Hyn;yn0
link together two feature locations yn and yn0. Although rarely made explicit, the
manipulation of these links is the very essence of Gaussian solutions to the SLAM
problem. It will be an analysis of these links that ultimately leads to a constant-time
solution to the SLAM problem.

2.2 Measurement Updates
In SLAM, measurements zt carry spatial information on the relation of the robots
pose and the location of a feature. For example, zt might be the approximate range
and bearing to a nearby landmark. Without loss of generality, we will assume that
each measurement zt corresponds to exactly one feature in the map. Sightings of
multiple features at the same time may easily be processed one-after-another.

Figure 3 illustrates the effect of measurements on the information matrix Ht.
Suppose the robot measures the approximate range and bearing to the feature y1, as
illustrated in Figure 3a. This observation links the robot pose xt to the location of
y1. The strength of the link is given by the level of noise in the measurement. Updat-
ing EIFs based on this measurement involves the manipulation of the off-diagonal
elements Hxt;y and their symmetric counterparts Hy;xt that link together xt and y.
Additionally, the on-diagonal elements Hxt;xt and Hy1;y1 are also updated. These
updates are additive: Each observation of a feature y increases the strength of the

total link between the robot pose and this very feature, and with it the total infor-
mation in the lter . Figure 3b shows the incorporation of a second measurement of
a different feature, y2. In response to this measurement, the EIF updates the links
(and Hxt;xt and Hy2;y2). As this example suggests, measurements
Hxt;y2 = H T
introduce links only between the robot pose xt and observed features. Measure-
ments never generate links between pairs of landmarks, or between the robot and
unobserved landmarks.

y2;xt

For a mathematical derivation of the update rule, we observe that Bayes rule

enables us to factor the desired posterior into the following product:
p((cid:24)t j zt; ut) / p(zt j (cid:24)t; zt(cid:0)1; ut) p((cid:24)t j zt(cid:0)1; ut)

= p(zt j (cid:24)t) p((cid:24)t j zt(cid:0)1; ut)

(8)

The second step of this derivation exploited common (and obvious) independences
in SLAM problems [33]. For the time being, we assume that p((cid:24)t j zt(cid:0)1; ut) is
represented by (cid:22)Ht and (cid:22)bt. Those will be discussed in the next section, where robot
motion will be addressed. The key question addressed in this section, thus, concerns
the representation of the probability distribution p(zt j (cid:24)t) and the mechanics of
carrying out the multiplication above. In the extended family of lters, a com-
mon model of robot perception is one in which measurements are governed via a
deterministic non-linear measurement function h with added Gaussian noise:

zt = h((cid:24)t) + "t

(9)

Here "t is an independent noise variable with zero mean, whose covariance will be
denoted Z. Put into probabilistic terms, (9) species a Gaussian distribution over
the measurement space of the form

p(zt j (cid:24)t) / exp(cid:8)(cid:0) 1

2 (zt (cid:0) h((cid:24)t))T Z(cid:0)1(zt (cid:0) h((cid:24)t))(cid:9)

(10)

Following the rich literature of EKFs, EIFs approximate this Gaussian by linearizing
the measurement function h. More specically , a Taylor series expansion of h gives
us

h((cid:24)t) (cid:25) h((cid:22)t) + r(cid:24)h((cid:22)t)[(cid:24)t (cid:0) (cid:22)t]

where r(cid:24)h((cid:22)t) is the rst derivative (Jacobian) of h with respect to the state variable
(cid:24), taken (cid:24) = (cid:22)t. For brevity, we will write ^zt = h((cid:22)t) to indicate that this is a pre-
diction given our state estimate (cid:22)t. The transpose of the Jacobian matrix r(cid:24)h((cid:22)t)
and will be denoted Ct. With these denitions, Equation (11) reads as follows:

h((cid:24)t) (cid:25) ^zt + C T

t ((cid:24)t (cid:0) (cid:22)t)

(12)

This approximation leads to the following Gaussian approximation of the measure-
ment density (10):

2 (zt (cid:0) ^zt (cid:0) C T

t (cid:24)t + C T

t (cid:22)t)T Z(cid:0)1(zt (cid:0) ^zt (cid:0) C T

t (cid:24)t + C T

Multiplying out the exponent and regrouping the resulting terms gives us

t CtZ(cid:0)1C T

t (cid:24)t + (zt (cid:0) ^zt + C T
t (cid:22)t)T Z(cid:0)1(zt (cid:0) ^zt + C T

t (cid:22)t)T Z(cid:0)1C T

t (cid:24)t

t (cid:22)t)(cid:9)

As before, the nal term in the exponent does not depend on the variable (cid:24)t and
hence can be subsumed into the proportionality factor:

t (cid:24)t + (zt (cid:0) ^zt + C T

t (cid:22)t)T Z(cid:0)1C T

(15)

We are now in the position to state the measurement update equation, which imple-
ment the probabilistic law (8).

t (cid:24)t(cid:9)

p(zt j (cid:24)t) / exp(cid:8)(cid:0) 1

Thus, the measurement update of the EIF is given by the following additive rule:

Ht = (cid:22)Ht + CtZ(cid:0)1C T
t
bt = (cid:22)bt + (zt (cid:0) ^zt + C T

t (cid:22)t)T Z(cid:0)1C T
t

(17)
(18)

In the general case, these updates may modify the entire information matrix Ht and
vector bt, respectively. A key observation of all SLAM problems is that the Jacobian
Ct is sparse. In particular, Ct is zero except for the elements that correspond to the
robot pose xt and the feature yt observed at time t.

Ct =(cid:16) @h

@xt

0(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) 0 @h

@yt

0(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) 0(cid:17)T

This sparseness is due to the fact that measurements zt are only a function of the
relative distance and orientation of the robot to the observed feature. As a pleasing
consequence, the update CtZ(cid:0)1C T
to the information matrix in (17) is only non-
t
zero in four places: the off-diagonal elements that link the robot pose xt with the
observed feature yt, and the main-diagonal elements that correspond to xt and yt.
Thus, the update equations (17) and (18) are well in tune with our intuitive descrip-
tion given in the beginning of this section, where we argued that measurements only

strengthen the links between the robot pose and observed features, in the informa-
tion matrix.

To compare this to the EKF solution, we notice that even though the change of
the information matrix is local, the resulting covariance usually changes in non-local
ways. put differently, the difference between the old covariance (cid:22)(cid:6)t = (cid:22)H(cid:0)1
and the
new covariance matrix (cid:6)t = H(cid:0)1

is usually non-zero everywhere.

2.3 Motion Updates
The second important step of SLAM concerns the update of the lter in accordance
to robot motion. In the standard SLAM problem, only the robot pose changes over
time. The environment is static.

The effect of robot motion on the information matrix Ht are slightly more com-
plicated than that of measurements. Figure 4a illustrates an information matrix and
the associated network before the robot moves, in which the robot is linked to two
(previously observed) landmarks. If robot motion was free of noise, this link struc-
ture would not be affected by robot motion. However, the noise in robot actuation
weakens the link between the robot and all active features. Hence Hxt;y1 and Hxt;y2
are decreased by a certain amount. This decrease reects the fact that the noise in
motion induces a loss of information of the relative location of the features to the
robot. Not all of this information is lost, however. Some of it is shifted into between-
landmark links Hy1;y2, as illustrated in Figure 4b. This reects the fact that even
though the motion induced a loss of information of the robot relative to the features,
no information was lost between individual features. Robot motion, thus, has the
effect that features that were indirectly linked through the robot pose become linked
directly.

To derive the update rule, we begin with a Bayesian description of robot mo-
tion. Updating a lter based on robot motion motion involves the calculation of the
following posterior:

Exploiting the common SLAM independences [33] leads to

p((cid:24)t j zt(cid:0)1; ut) =Z p((cid:24)t j (cid:24)t(cid:0)1; zt(cid:0)1; ut) p((cid:24)t(cid:0)1 j zt(cid:0)1; ut) d(cid:24)t(cid:0)1
=Z p((cid:24)t j (cid:24)t(cid:0)1; ut) p((cid:24)t(cid:0)1 j zt(cid:0)1; ut(cid:0)1) d(cid:24)t(cid:0)1

The term p((cid:24)t(cid:0)1 j zt(cid:0)1; ut(cid:0)1) is the posterior at time t (cid:0) 1, represented by Ht(cid:0)1
and bt(cid:0)1. Our concern will therefore be with the remaining term p((cid:24)t j (cid:24)t(cid:0)1; ut),
which characterizes robot motion in probabilistic terms.
Similar to the measurement model above, it is common practice to model robot

motion by a non-linear function with added independent Gaussian noise:

with

(cid:24)t = (cid:24)t(cid:0)1 + (cid:1)t

(cid:1)t = g((cid:24)t(cid:0)1; ut) + Sx(cid:14)t

(22)
Here g is the motion model, a vector-valued function which is non-zero only for the
robot pose coordinates, as feature locations are static in SLAM. The term labeled (cid:1)t
constitutes the state change at time t. The stochastic part of this change is modeled
by (cid:14)t, a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and covariance Ut. This Gaussian
variable is a low-dimensional variable dened for the robot pose only. Here Sx is a
projection matrix of the form Sx = ( I 0 : : : 0 )T , where I is an identity matrix of
the same dimension as the robot pose vector xt and as of (cid:14)t. Each 0 in this matrix
refers to a null matrix, of which there are N in Sx. The product Sx(cid:14)t, hence, give
the following generalized noise variable, enlarged to the dimension of the full state
vector (cid:24): Sx(cid:14)t = ( (cid:14)t 0 : : : 0 )T . In EIFs, the function g in (22) is approximated
by its rst degree Taylor series expansion:

g((cid:24)t(cid:0)1; ut) (cid:25) g((cid:22)t(cid:0)1; ut) + r(cid:24)g((cid:22)t(cid:0)1; ut)[(cid:24)t(cid:0)1 (cid:0) (cid:22)t(cid:0)1]

= ^(cid:1)t + At(cid:24)t(cid:0)1 (cid:0) At(cid:22)t(cid:0)1

(23)
Here At = r(cid:24)g((cid:22)t(cid:0)1; ut) is the derivative of g with respect to (cid:24) at (cid:24) = (cid:22)t(cid:0)1 and
ut. The symbol ^(cid:1)t is short for the predicted motion effect, g((cid:22)t(cid:0)1; ut). Plugging
this approximation into (22) leads to an approximation of (cid:24)t, the state at time t:
(cid:24)t (cid:25) (I + At)(cid:24)t(cid:0)1 + ^(cid:1)t (cid:0) At(cid:22)t(cid:0)1 + Sx(cid:14)t
(24)
Hence, under this approximation the random variable (cid:24)t is again Gaussian dis-
tributed. Its mean is obtained by replacing (cid:24)t and (cid:14)t in (24) by their respective
means:
(cid:22)(cid:22)t = (I + At)(cid:22)t(cid:0)1 + ^(cid:1)t (cid:0) At(cid:22)t(cid:0)1 + Sx0 = (cid:22)t(cid:0)1 + ^(cid:1)t
(25)
The covariance of (cid:24)t is simply obtained by scaled and adding the covariance of the
Gaussian variables on the right-hand side of (24):
(cid:22)(cid:6)t = (I + At)(cid:6)t(cid:0)1(I + At)T + 0 (cid:0) 0 + SxUtST

= (I + At)(cid:6)t(cid:0)1(I + At)T + SxUtST

(26)
Update equations (25) and (26) are in the EKF form, that is, they are dened over
means and covariances. The information form is now easily recovered from the
denition of the information form in (4) and its inverse in (6). In particular, we have

SLAM With Sparse Extended Information Filters: Theory and Initial Results

These equations appear computationally involved, in that they require the inversion
of large matrices. In the general case, the complexity of the EIF is therefore cubic in
the size of the state space. In the next section, we provide the surprising result that
both (cid:22)Ht and (cid:22)bt can be computed in constant time if Ht(cid:0)1 is sparse.
3 Sparse Extended Information Filters

The central, new algorithm presented in this paper is the Sparse Extended Informa-
tion Filter, or SEIF. SEIF differ from the extended information lter described in
the previous section in that is maintains a sparse information matrix. An informa-
tion matrix Ht is considered sparse if the number of links to the robot and to each
feature in the map is bounded by a constant that is independent of the number of
features in the map. The bound for the number of links between the robot pose and
other features in the map will be denoted (cid:18)x; the bound on the number of links for
each feature (not counting the link to the robot) will be denoted (cid:18)y. The motivation
for maintaining a sparse information matrix was already given above: In SLAM,
the normalized information matrix is already almost sparse. This suggests that by
enforcing sparseness, the induced approximation error is small.

3.1 Constant Time Results
We begin by proving three important constant time results, which form the backbone
of SEIFs. All proofs can be found in the appendix.

Lemma1:ThemeasurementupdateinSection(2.2)requiresconstanttime,ir-

respectiveofthenumberoffeaturesinthemap.

This lemma ensures that measurements can be incorporated in constant time.
Notice that this lemma does not require sparseness of the information matrix; rather,
it is a well-known property of information lters in SLAM.

Less trivial is the following lemma:
Lemma2:Iftheinformationmatrixissparseand At = 0,themotionupdatein

by:

(cid:22)bt = bt(cid:0)1 + ^(cid:1)T

t Ht(cid:0)1 (cid:0) bt(cid:0)1Lt + ^(cid:1)T

t Ht(cid:0)1Lt

(29)

This result addresses the important special case At = 0, that is, the Jacobian of pose
change with respect to the absolute robot pose is zero. This is the case for robots
with linear mechanics, and with non-linear mechanics where there is no cross-talk
between absolute coordinates and the additive change due to motion.

case is addressed by the next lemma:

In general, At 6= 0, since the x-y update depends on the robot orientation. This

requires constant time if the mean (cid:22)t is available for the robot pose and all active
landmarks.Theconstant-timeupdateequationsaregivenby:

For At 6= 0, a constant time update requires knowledge of the mean (cid:22)t(cid:0)1 before
the motion command, for the robot pose and all active landmarks (but not the pas-
sive features). This information is not maintained by the standard information lter ,
and extracting it in the straightforward way (via Equation (6)) requires more than
constant time. A constant-time solution to this problem will now be presented.

3.2 Amortized Approximated Map Recovery
Before deriving an algorithm for recovering the state estimate (cid:22)t from the informa-
tion form, let us briey consider what parts of (cid:22)t are needed in SEIFs, and when.
SEIFs need the state estimate (cid:22)t of the robot pose and the active features in the
map. These estimates are needed at three different occasions: (1) the linearization
of the non-linear measurement and motion model, (2) the motion update according
to Lemma 3, and (3) the sparsication technique described further below. For lin-
ear systems, the means are only needed for the sparsication (third point above). We
also note that we only need constantly many of the values in (cid:22)t, namely the estimate
of the robot pose and of the locations of active features.

As stated in (6), the mean vector (cid:22)t is a function of Ht and bt:
(cid:22)t = H(cid:0)1

t = (cid:6)tbT
t

t bT

(31)

Unfortunately, calculating (31) directly involves inverting a large matrix, which
would requires more than constant time.

The sparseness of the matrix Ht allows us to recover the state incrementally. In
particular, we can do so on-line, as the data is being gathered and the estimates b
and H are being constructed. To do so, it will prove convenient to pose (31) as an
optimization problem:

Lemma4:Thestate (cid:22)t isthemode ^(cid:23)t := argmax(cid:23)t p((cid:23)t) oftheGaussiandis-

tribution,dened overthevariable(cid:23)t:

(32)

p((cid:23)t) = const: (cid:1) exp(cid:8)(cid:0) 1

2 (cid:23)T

t Ht(cid:23)t + bT

t (cid:23)t(cid:9)

Here (cid:23)t is a vector of the same form and dimensionality as (cid:22)t. This lemma suggests
that recovering (cid:22)t is equivalent to nding the mode of (32). Thus, it transforms a
matrix inversion problem into an optimization problem. For this optimization prob-
lem, we will now describe an iterative hill climbing algorithm which, thanks to the
sparseness of the information matrix, requires only constant time per optimization
update.

Our approach is an instantiation of coordinate descent. For simplicity, we state
it here for a single coordinate only; our implementation iterates a constant number
K of such optimizations after each measurement update step. The mode ^(cid:23)t of (32)
is attained at:

^(cid:23)t = argmax

We note that the argument of the min-operator in (33) can be written in a form that
makes the individual coordinate variables (cid:23)i;t (for the i-th coordinate of (cid:23)t) explicit:

where Hi;j;t is the element with coordinates (i; j) in Ht, and bi;t if the i-th com-
ponent of the vector bt. Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to an
arbitrary coordinate variable (cid:23)i;t gives us

(35)

Setting this to zero leads to the optimum of the i-th coordinate variable (cid:23)i;t given all
other estimates (cid:23)j;t:

The same expression can conveniently be written in matrix notation, were Si is a
projection matrix for extracting the i-th component from the matrix Ht:

(cid:23)[k+1]
i;t = (ST

i HtSi)(cid:0)1ST

t + HtSiST

All other estimates (cid:23)i0;t with i0 6= i remain unchanged in this update step, that is,
i0;t = (cid:23)[k]
(cid:23)[k+1]
i0;t.
As is easily seen, the number of elements in the summation in (36), and hence the
vector multiplication in (37), is constant if Ht is sparse. Hence, each update requires
constant time. To maintain the constant-time property of our SLAM algorithm, we
can afford a constant number of updates K per time step. This will generally not
lead to convergence, but the relaxation process takes place over multiple time steps,
resulting in small errors in the overall estimate.

3.3 Sparsication
The nal step in SEIFs concerns the sparsication of the information matrix Ht.
Sparsication is necessarily an approximative step, since information matrices in
SLAM are naturally not sparseeven though normalized information matrices tend
to be almost sparse. In the context of SLAM, it sufces to remove links (deactivate)
between the robot pose and individual features in the map; if done correctly, this
also limits the number of links between pairs of features.

To see, let us briey consider the two circumstances under which a new link may
be introduced. First, observing a passive feature activates this feature, that is, intro-
duces a new link between the robot pose and the very feature. Thus, measurement
updates potentially violate the bound (cid:18)x. Second, motion introduces links between
any two active features, and hence lead to violations of the bound (cid:18)y. This consider-
ation suggests that controlling the number of active features can avoid violation of
both sparseness bounds.

Our sparsication technique is illustrated in Figure 5. Shown there is the situa-
tion before and after sparsication. The removal of a link in the network corresponds
to setting an element in the information matrix to zero; however, this requires the
manipulation of other links between the robot and other active landmarks. The re-
sulting network is only an approximation to the original one, whose quality depends
on the magnitude of the link before removal.

We will now present a constant-time sparsication technique. To do so, it will

prove useful to partition the set of all features into three subsets:
Y = Y + ] Y 0 ] Y (cid:0)
where Y + is the set of all active features that shall remain active. Y 0 are one or more
active features that we seek to deactivate (remove the link to the robot). Finally, Y (cid:0)
are all currently passive features.

(38)

The sparsication is best derived from rst principles. If Y+ ] Y 0 contains all

currently active features, the posterior can be factored as follows:
p(xt; Y j zt; ut) = p(xt; Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0) j zt; ut)

= p(xt j Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0); zt; ut) p(Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0) j zt; ut)
= p(xt j Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0) = 0; zt; ut) p(Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0) j zt; ut) (39)
In the last step we exploited the fact that if we know the active features Y 0 and
Y +, the variable xt does not depend on the passive features Y (cid:0). We can hence
set Y (cid:0) to an arbitrary value without affecting the conditional posterior over xt,
p(xt j Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0); zt; ut). Here we simply chose Y (cid:0) = 0.
To sparsify the information matrix, the posterior is approximated by the follow-
ing distribution, in which we simply drop the dependence on Y 0 in the rst term.
It is easily shown that this distribution minimizes the KL divergence to the exact,
non-sparse distribution:
~p(xt; Y j zt; ut) = p(xt j Y +; Y (cid:0) = 0; zt; ut) p(Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0) j zt; ut)
p(Y 0; Y +; Y (cid:0) j zt; ut)

p(xt; Y + j Y (cid:0) = 0; zt; ut)
p(Y + j Y (cid:0) = 0; zt; ut)

(40)

=

SLAM With Sparse Extended Information Filters: Theory and Initial Results

15

This posterior is calculated in constant time. In particular, we begin by calculating
the information matrix for the distribution p(xt; Y 0; Y + j Y (cid:0) = 0) of all variables
but Y (cid:0), and conditioned on Y (cid:0) = 0. This is obtained by extracting the submatrix
of all state variables but Y (cid:0):

H0t = Sx;Y +;Y 0ST

x;Y +;Y 0 HtSx;Y +;Y 0 ST

x;Y +;Y 0

(41)

With that, the inversion lemma leads to the following information matrices for the
terms p(xt; Y + j Y (cid:0) = 0; zt; ut) and p(Y + j Y (cid:0) = 0; zt; ut), denoted H 1
t and
t , respectively:
H 2
t = H0t (cid:0) H0tSY0(ST
H 1
t = H0t (cid:0) H0tSx;Y0(ST
H 2

Y0 H0t
Y0 H0tSY0)(cid:0)1ST
x;Y0 H0tSx;Y0 )(cid:0)1ST

x;Y0H0t

(42)

Here the various S-matrices are projection matrices, analogous to the matrix Sx
dened above. The nal term in our approximation (40), p(Y0; Y +; Y (cid:0) j zt; ut),
has the following information matrix:

t = Ht (cid:0) HtSxt(ST
H 3

xt HtSxt )(cid:0)1ST

xtHt

(43)

Putting these expressions together according to Equation (40) yields the following
information matrix, in which the landmark Y 0 is now indeed deactivated:

~Ht = H 1

t + H 3

t (cid:0) H 2
+H0tSx;Y0 (ST

t = Ht (cid:0) H0tSY0(ST

Y0 H0tSY0 )(cid:0)1ST
x;Y0 H0t (cid:0) HtSxt (ST

Y0 H0t

xt HtSxt)(cid:0)1ST

xtHt

(44)

The resulting information vector is now obtained by the following simple consider-
ation:

~bt = (cid:22)T
~Ht = (cid:22)T
t
= (cid:22)T
t Ht + (cid:22)T

t (Ht (cid:0) Ht + ~Ht)
t ( ~Ht (cid:0) Ht) = bt + (cid:22)T

t ( ~Ht (cid:0) Ht)

(45)

All equations can be computed in constant time. The effect of this approximation
is the deactivation of the features Y 0, while introducing only new links between
active features. The sparsication rule requires knowledge of the mean vector (cid:22)t
for all active features, which is obtained via the approximation technique described
in the previous section. From (45), it is obvious that the sparsication does not
t = [ ~Ht](cid:0)1[~bt]T . Furthermore, our approximation
affect the mean (cid:22)t, that is, H(cid:0)1
minimizes the KL divergence to the correct posterior. These property is essential for
the consistency of our approximation.

t bT

The sparsication is executed whenever a measurement update or a motion up-
date would violate a sparseness constraint. Active features are chosen for deactiva-
tion in reverse order of the magnitude of their link. This strategy tends to deactivate
features whose last sighting is furthest away in time. Empirically, it induces approx-
imation errors that are negligible for appropriately chosen sparseness constraints (cid:18)x
and (cid:18)y.

4 Experimental Results

Our present experiments are preliminary: They only rely on simulated data, and
they require known data associations. Our primary goal was to compare SEIFs to
the computationally more cumbersome EKF solution that is currently in widespread
use.

An example situation comparing EKFs with our new lter can be found in Fig-
ure 6. This result is typical and was obtained using a sparse information matrix
with (cid:18)x = 6, (cid:18)x = 10, and a constant time implementation of coordinate descent
that updates K = 10 random landmark estimates in addition to the landmark esti-
mates connected to the robot at any given time. The key observation is the apparent
similarity between the EKF and the SEIF result. Both estimates are almost indis-
tinguishable, despite the fact that EKFs use quadratic update time whereas SEIF
require only constant time.

We also performed systematic comparisons of three algorithms: EKFs, SEIFs,
and a variant of SEIFs in which the exact state estimate (cid:22)t is available. The latter
was implemented using matrix inversion (hence does not run in constant time). It
allowed us to tease apart the error introduced by the amortized mean recovery step,
from the error induced through sparsication. The following table depicts results for
N = 50 landmarks, after 500 update cycles, at which point all three approaches are
near convergence.

As these results suggest, our approach approximates EKF very tightly. The residual
map error of our approach is with 6:35 (cid:1) 10(cid:0)3 approximately 14.6% higher than
that of the extended Kalman lter . This error appears to be largely caused by the
coordinate descent procedure, and is possibly inated by the fact that K = 10 is a
small value given the size of the map. Enforcing the sparseness constraint seems not
to have any negative effect on the overall error of the resulting map, as the results
for our sparse lter implementation suggest. Experimental results using a real-world
data set can be found in [14].

5 Discussion

This paper proposed a constant time algorithm for the SLAM problem. Our ap-
proach adopted the information form of the EKF to represent all estimates. Based
on the empirical observation that in the information form, most elements in the
normalized information matrix are near-zero, we developed a sparse extended in-
formation lter , or SEIF. This lter enforces a sparse information matrix, which can
be updated in constant time. In the linear SLAM case, all updates can be performed
in constant time; in the non-linear case, additional state estimates are needed that
are not part of the regular information form of the EKF. We proposed a amortized
constant-time coordinate descent algorithm for recovering these state estimates from
the information form.

The approach has been fully implemented and compared to the EKF solution.
Overall, we found that SEIFs produce results that differ only marginally from that
of the EKFs. Given the computational advantages of SEIFs over EKFs, we believe
that SEIFs should be a viable alternative to EKF solutions when building high-
dimensional maps.

Our approach puts a new perspective on the rich literature on hierarchical map-
ping, briey outlined in the introduction to this paper. Like SEIF, these techniques
focus updates on a subset of all features, to gain computational efcienc y. SEIFs,
however, composes submaps dynamically, whereas past work relied on the deni-
tion of static submaps. We conjecture that our sparse network structures capture the
natural dependencies in SLAM problems much better than static submap decom-
positions, and in turn lead to more accurate results. They also avoid problems that
frequently occur at the boundary of submaps, where the estimation can become un-
stable. However, the verication of these claims will be subject to future research.
A related paper discusses the application of constant time techniques to information
exchange problems in multi-robot SLAM [22].
