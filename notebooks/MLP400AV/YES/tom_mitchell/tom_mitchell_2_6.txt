Abstract

Over the past 50 years the study of Machine Learning has grown from the efforts of a handful of computer en-
gineers exploring whether computers could learn to play games, and a eld of Statistics that largely ignored
computational considerations, to a broad discipline that has produced fundamental statistical-computational
theories of learning processes, has designed learning algorithms that are routinely used in commercial sys-
tems for speech recognition, computer vision, and a variety of other tasks, and has spun off an industry in
data mining to discover hidden regularities in the growing volumes of online data. This document provides a
brief and personal view of the discipline that has emerged as Machine Learning, the fundamental questions
it addresses, its relationship to other sciences and society, and where it might be headed.

Keywords: machine learning

1 Dening Questions

A scientic eld is best dened by the central question it studies. The eld of Machine Learning seeks to
answer the question

How can we build computer systems that automatically improve with experience, and what
are the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes?

This question covers a broad range of learning tasks, such as how to design autonomous mobile robots that
learn to navigate from their own experience, how to data mine historical medical records to learn which
future patients will respond best to which treatments, and how to build search engines that automatically
customize to their users interests. To be more precise, we say that a machine learns with respect to a partic-
ular task T, performance metric P, and type of experience E, if the system reliably improves its performance
P at task T, following experience E. Depending on how we specify T, P, and E, the learning task might
also be called by names such as data mining, autonomous discovery, database updating, programming by
example, etc.

Machine Learning is a natural outgrowth of the intersection of Computer Science and Statistics. We
might say the dening question of Computer Science is How can we build machines that solve problems,
and which problems are inherently tractable/intractable? The question that largely denes Statistics is
What can be inferred from data plus a set of modeling assumptions, with what reliability? The dening
question for Machine Learning builds on both, but it is a distinct question. Whereas Computer Science has
focused primarily on how to manually program computers, Machine Learning focuses on the question of
how to get computers to program themselves (from experience plus some initial structure). Whereas Statis-
tics has focused primarily on what conclusions can be inferred from data, Machine Learning incorporates
additional questions about what computational architectures and algorithms can be used to most effectively
capture, store, index, retrieve and merge these data, how multiple learning subtasks can be orchestrated in a
larger system, and questions of computational tractability.

A third eld whose dening question is closely related to Machine Learning is the study of human
and animal learning in Psychology, Neuroscience, and related elds. The questions of how computers can
learn and how animals learn most probably have highly intertwined answers. To date, however, the insights
Machine Learning has gained from studies of Human Learning are much weaker than those it has gained
from Statistics and Computer Science, due primarily to the weak state of our understanding of Human
Learning. Nevertheless, the synergy between studies of machine and human learning is growing, with
machine learning algorithms such as temporal difference learning now being suggested as explanations for
neural signals observed in learning animals. Over the coming years it is reasonable to expect the synergy
between studies of Human Learning and Machine Learning to grow substantially, as they are close neighbors
in the landscape of core scientic questions.

Other elds, from biology to ecomonics to control theory also have a core interest in the question of
how systems can automatically adapt or optimize to their environment, and machine learning will likely
have an increasing exchange of ideas with these elds over the coming years. For example, economics is
interested in questions such as how distributed collections of self-interested individuals may form a system
(market) that learns prices leading to pareto-optimal allocations for the greatest common good. And control
theory, especially adaptive control theory, is interested in questions such as how a servo-control system
can improve its control strategy through experience. Interestingly, the mathematical models for adaptation
in these other elds are somewhat different from those commonly used in machine learning, suggesting
signicant potential for cross-fertilization of models and theories.

The following sections discuss the state of the art of Machine Learning, a sample of successful applica-

tions, and a sample of open research questions.

2 State of Machine Learning

Here we describe some of the progress in machine learning, as well as open research questions.

2.1 Application Successes

One measure of progress in Machine Learning is its signicant real-world applications, such as those listed
below. Although we now take many of these applications for granted, it is worth noting that as late as 1985
there were almost no commercial applications of machine learning.

 Speech recognition. Currently available commercial systems for speech recognition all use machine
learning in one fashion or another to train the system to recognize speech. The reason is simple: the
speech recognition accuracy is greater if one trains the system, than if one attempts to program it
by hand. In fact, many commercial speech recognition systems involve two distinct learning phases:
one before the software is shipped (training the general system in a speaker-independent fashion),
and a second phase after the user purchases the software (to achieve greater accuracy by training in a
speaker-dependent fashion).

 Computer vision. Many current vision systems, from face recognition systems, to systems that auto-
matically classify microscope images of cells, are developed using machine learning, again because
the resulting systems are more accurate than hand-crafted programs. One massive-scale application
of computer vision trained using machine learning is its use by the US Post Ofce to automatically
sort letters containing handwritten addresses. Over 85% of handwritten mail in the US is sorted auto-
matically, using handwriting analysis software trained to very high accuracy using machine learning
over a very large data set.

 Bio-surveillance. A variety of government efforts to detect and track disease outbreaks now use ma-
chine learning. For example, the RODS project involves real-time collection of admissions reports to
emergency rooms across western Pennsylvania, and the use of machine learning software to learn the
prole of typical admissions so that it can detect anomalous patterns of symptoms and their geograph-
ical distribution. Current work involves adding in a rich set of additional data, such as retail purchases
of over-the-counter medicines to increase the information ow into the system, further increasing the
need for automated learning methods given this even more complex data set.

 Robot control. Machine learning methods have been successfully used in a number of robot systems.
For example, several researchers have demonstrated the use of machine learning to acquire control
strategies for stable helicopter ight and helicopter aerobatics. The recent Darpa-sponsored competi-
tion involving a robot driving autonomously for over 100 miles in the desert was won by a robot that
used machine learning to rene its ability to detect distant objects (training itself from self-collected
data consisting of terrain seen initially in the distance, and seen later up close).

 Accelerating empirical sciences. Many data-intensive sciences now make use of machine learning
methods to aid in the scientic discovery process. Machine learning is being used to learn models
of gene expression in the cell from high-throughput data, to discover unusual astronomical objects

2

from massive data collected by the Sloan sky survey, and to characterize the complex patterns of
brain activation that indicate different cognitive states of people in fMRI scanners. Machine learning
methods are reshaping the practice of many data-intensive empirical sciences, and many of these
sciences now hold workshops on machine learning as part of their elds conferences.

2.2 Place of Machine Learning within Computer Science

Given this sample of applications, what can we infer in general about the future role of machine learning
in the eld of computer applications? One way to think about this is to imagine the space of all software
applications, and to recognize the above applications suggest a niche within this space where machine
learning has a special role to play. In particular, machine learning methods are already the best methods
available for developing particular types of software, in applications where:

 The application is too complex for people to manually design the algorithm. For example, software for
sensor-base perception tasks, such as speech recognition and computer vision, fall into this category.
All of us can easily label which photographs contain a picture of our mother, but none of us can write
down an algorithm to perform this task. Here machine learning is the software development method
of choice simply because it is relatively easy to collect labeled training data, and relatively ineffective
to try writing down a successful algorithm.

 The application requires that the software customize to its operational environment after it is elded.
One example of this is speech recognition systems that customize to the user who purchases the
software. Machine learning here provides the mechanism for adaptation. Software applications that
customize to users are growing rapidly - e.g., bookstores that customize to your purchasing prefer-
ences, or email readers that customize to your particular denition of spam. This machine learning
niche within the software world is growing rapidly.

Viewed this way, machine learning methods play a key role in the world of computer science, within an
important and growing niche. While there will remain software applications where machine learning may
never be useful (e.g., to write matrix multiplication programs), the niche where it will be used is growing
rapidly as applications grow in complexity, as the demand grows for self-customizing software, as computers
gain access to more data, and as we develop increasingly effective machine learning algorithms.

Beyond its obvious role as a method for software development, machine learning is also likely to help
reshape our view of Computer Science more generally. By shifting the question from how to program
computers to how to allow them to program themselves, machine learning emphasizes the design of self-
monitoring systems that self-diagnose and self-repair, and on approaches that model their users, and the
take advantage of the steady stream of data owing through the program rather than simply processing it.
Similarly, Machine Learning will help reshape the eld of Statistics, by bringing a computational perspective
to the fore, and raising issues such as never-ending learning. Of course both Computer Science and Statistics
will also help shape Machine Learning as they progress and provide new ideas to change the way we view
learning.

2.3 Some Current Research Questions

As the above applications suggest, substantial progress has already been made in the development of ma-
chine learning algorithms and their underlying theory. For example, we now have a variety of algorithms for
supervised learning of classication and regression functions; that is, for learning some initially unknown

3

function f : X  Y given a set of labeled training examples {(cid:104)xi, yi(cid:105)} of inputs xi and outputs yi = f(xi).
For example, in training an image recognition program xi may be a single image, and yi the label of the
object in the image. Algorithms from Support Vector Machines, to Bayesian classiers, to Genetic Algo-
rithms may be used to estimate the function f from the data. We also have a useful body of theory that helps
characterize how accurately one should expect to learn the function f, depending on the number of labeled
training examples available, assumptions about the nature of the data (e.g., whether the examples are drawn
independently), and properties of the learning algorithm such as the complexity of the set of hypotheses it
considers. Of course there are many other types of learning problems and associated algorithms and theo-
ries, including unsupervised clustering (e.g., cluster genes based on their time series expression patterns),
anomaly detection (e.g., nd unusual patterns of emergency room admissions), reinforcement learning (e.g.,
learn to pick good chess moves, where the only training data is the nal win/lose outcome of the game after
making many moves), data modeling (e.g., nd a small set of factors that can be combined to reconstruct a
sequence of high-dimensional brain images), etc.

The eld is moving forward in many directions, exploring a variety of types of learning tasks, and

developing a variety of underlying theory. Here is a sample of current research questions:

 Can unlabeled data be helpful for supervised learning? Supervised learning involves estimating some
function f : X  Y given a set of labeled training examples {(cid:104)xi, yi(cid:105)}. We could dramatically reduce
the cost of supervised learning if we could make use of unlabeled data as well (e.g., images that are
unlabeled). Are there situations where unlabeled data can be guaranteed to improve the expected
learning accuracy? Interesting, the answer is yes, for several special cases of learning problems that
satisfy additional assumptions. These include practical problems such as learning to classify web
pages or spam. Exploration of new algorithms and new subclasses of problems where unlabeled data
is provably useful is an active area of current research.

 How can we transfer what is learned for one task to improve learning in other related tasks?. Note
the above formulation of supervised learning involves learning a single function f. In many practical
problems we might like to learn a family of related functions (e.g., a diagnosis function for patients
in New York hospitals, and one for patients in Tokyo hospitals). Although we expect the diagnosis
function to be somewhat different in the two cases, we also expect some commonalities. Methods
such as hierarchical Bayesian approaches provide one way to tackle this problem, by assuming the
learning parameters of the NY function and the Tokyo function share similar prior probabilities, but
allowing the data from each hospital to override these priors as appropriate. The situation becomes
more subtle when the transfer between functions is more complex  e.g.., a robot learning both a
next-state function and a function to chose control actions should be able to learn better by taking
advantage of the logical relationship between these two types of learned information.

 What is the relationship between different learning algorithms, and which should be used when?.
Many different learning algorithms have been proposed and evaluated experimentally in different ap-
plication domains. One theme of research is to develop a theoretical understanding of the relationships
among these algorithms, and of when it is appropriate to use each. For example, two algorithms for
supervised learning, Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes classier, behave differently on many
data sets, but can be proved to be equivalent when applied to certain types of data sets (i.e., when
the modeling assumptions of Naive Bayes are satised, and as the number of training examples ap-
proaches innity). This understanding suggests, for example, that Naive Bayes should be preferred
if data is sparse but one is condent of the modeling assumptions. More generally, the theoretical

4

characterization of learning algorithms, their convergence properties, and their relative strengths and
weaknesses remains a major research topic.

 For learners that actively collect their own training data, what is the best strategy? Imagine a mobile
robot charged with the task of learning to nd its masters slippers anywhere in the house, and imagine
that it is allowed to practice during the day, by viewing the slippers from different viewpoints of its
choice, and moving the slippers to different locations with different lighting conditions. What is the
most efcient training strategy for actively collecting new data as its learning proceeds? A second
example of this problem involves drug testing where one wishes to learn the drug effectiveness while
minimizing the exposure of patients to possible unknown side effects. This is a part of a more broad
research thrust into learning systems that take more active control over the learning setting, rather than
passively using data collected by others.

 To what degree can we have both data privacy and the benets of data mining? There are many bene-
cial uses of machine learning, such as training a medical diagnosis system on data from all hospitals
in the world, which are not being pursued largely because of privacy considerations. Although at rst
it might seem that we must choose between privacy and the benets of data mining, in fact we might
be able to have both in some cases. For example, rather than forcing hospitals to sacrice privacy and
pass around their patient records to a central data repository, we might instead pass around a learning
algorithm to the hospitals, allowing each to run it under certain restrictions, then pass it along to the
next hospital. This is an active research area, building both on past statistical work on data disclosure
and on more recent cryptographic approaches.

2.3.1 Longer Term Research Questions

The above research questions are already being energetically pursued by researchers in the eld. It is also
interesting to consider longer term research questions. Below are some additional research topics which I
feel hold the potential to signicantly change the face of machine learning over the coming decade.

 Can we build never-ending learners? The vast majority of machine learning work to date involves run-
ning programs on particular data sets, then putting the learner aside and using the result. In contrast,
learning in humans and other animals is an ongoing process in which the agent learns many different
capabilities, often in a sequenced curriculum, and uses these different learned facts and capabilities in
a highly synergistic fashion. Why not build machine learners that learn in this same cumulative way,
becoming increasingly competent rather than halting at some plateau? For example, a robot in the
same ofce building for months or years should learn a variety of capabilities, starting with simpler
tasks (e.g., how to recognize objects in that dark end of the hallway), to more complex problems that
build on previous learning (e.g., where to look rst to nd the missing recycling container). Similarly,
a program to learn to read the web might learn a graded set of capabilities beginning with simpler abil-
ities such as learning to recognize names of people and places, and extending to extracting complex
relational information spread across multiple sentences and web pages. A key research issue here is
self-supervised learning and constructing an appropriate graded curriculum.

 Can machine learning theories and algorithms help explain human learning? Recently, theories and
algorithms from machine learning have been found relevant to understanding aspects of human and
animal learning. For example, reinforcement learning algorithms and theories predict surprisingly

5

well the neural activity of dopaminergic neurons in animals during reward-based learning. And ma-
chine learning algorithms for discovering sparse representations of naturally occurring images predict
surprisingly well the types of visual features found in the early visual cortex of animals. However, the-
ories of animal learning involve considerations that have not yet been considered in machine learning,
such as the role of motivation, fear, urgency, forgetting, and learning over multiple time scales. There
is a rich opportunity for cross fertilization here, an opportunity to develop a general theory of learning
processes covering animals as well as machines, and potential implications for improved strategies
for teaching students.

 Can we design programming languages containing machine learning primitives? Can a new gen-
eration of computer programming languages directly support writing programs that learn? In many
current machine learning applications, standard machine learning algorithms are integrated with hand-
coded software into a nal application program. Why not design a new computer programming lan-
guage that supports writing programs in which some subroutines are hand-coded while others are
specied as to be learned. Such a programming language could allow the programmer to declare
the inputs and outputs of each to be learned subroutine, then select a learning algorithm from the
primitives provided by the programming language. Interesting new research issues arise here, such as
designing programming language constructs for declaring what training experience should be given to
each to be learned subroutine, when, and with what safeguards against arbitrary changes to program
behavior.

 Will computer perception merge with machine learning? Given the increasing use of machine learn-
ing for state-of-the-art computer vision, computer speech recognition, and other forms of computer
perception, can we develop a general theory of perception grounded in learning processes? One in-
triguing opportunity here the incorporation of multiple sensory modalities (e.g., vision, sound, touch)
to provide a setting in which self-supervised learning could be applied to predict one sensory experi-
ence from the others. Already researchers in developmental psychology and education have observed
that learning can be more effective when people are provided multiple input modalities, and work on
co-training methods from machine learning suggests the same.

2.4 Ethical Questions

Above are some of the problems that will shape the eld of machine learning over the coming decade. While
it is impossible to predict the future, further research in machine learning will almost certainly produce
more powerful computer capabilities. This, in turn, will lead on occasion to ethical questions about where
and when to apply the resulting technology. For example, consider that todays technology could enable
discovering unanticipated side effects of new drugs, if it were applied to data describing all doctor visits
and medical records in the country along with all purchases of drugs. Recent cases in which new drugs
were recalled following a number of unanticipated patient deaths might well have been ameliorated by
already available machine learning methods. However, applying this machine learning technology would
also have impacted our personal privacy, as our medial records and drug purchases would have had to be
captured and analyzed. Is this something we wish as a society to do? Personally, I believe there are good
arguments on both sides, and that as a society we need to discuss and debate these questions in an open and
informed fashion, then come to a decision. Related questions occur about collecting data for security and
law enforcement, or for marketing purposes. Like all powerful technologies, machine learning will raise its
share of questions about whether it should be used for particular purposes. Although the answer to each of

6

these questions will have a technical component, in some cases the question will also have a social policy
component requiring all of us to become engaged in deciding its answer.
