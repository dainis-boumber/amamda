Abstract
Many problems in neural computation and statistical learning involve optimizations with nonnegativity
constraints. In this article, we study convex problems in quadratic programming where the optimization is
confined to an axis-aligned region in the nonnegative orthant. For these problems, we derive multiplicative
updates that improve the value of the objective function at each iteration and converge monotonically to the
global minimum. The updates have a simple closed form and do not involve any heuristics or free parameters
that must be tuned to ensure convergence. Despite their simplicity, they differ strikingly in form from other
multiplicative updates used in machine learning.We provide complete proofs of convergence for these updates
and describe their application to problems in signal processing and pattern recognition.

Many problems in neural computation and statistical learning involve
optimizations with nonnegativity constraints. In this article, we study
convex problems in quadratic programming where the optimization is
conned to an axis-aligned region in the nonnegative orthant. For these
problems, we derive multiplicative updates that improve the value of
the objective function at each iteration and converge monotonically to
the global minimum. The updates have a simple closed form and do
not involve any heuristics or free parameters that must be tuned to en-
sure convergence. Despite their simplicity, they differ strikingly in form

Many problems in neural computation and statistical learning involve op-
timizations with nonnegativity constraints. Examples include large margin

in Bayesian networks (Bauer, Koller, & Singer, 1997), dimensionality reduc-
tion by nonnegative matrix factorization (Lee & Seung, 1999), and acoustic
echo cancellation (Lin, Lee, & Saul, 2004). The optimizations for these prob-
lems cannot be solved in closed form; thus, iterative learning rules are
required that converge in the limit to actual solutions.

The simplest such learning rule is gradient descent. Minimizing an ob-

jective function F (v) by gradient descent involves the additive update,

vi  vi  ( F /vi),

(1.1)

where  >0 is a positive learning rate and all the elements of the parameter
vector v = (v1, v2, . . . , vN) are updated in parallel. Gradient descent is not
particularly well suited to constrained optimizations, however, because the
additive update in equation 1.1 can lead to violations of the constraints. A
simple extension enforces the nonnegativity constraints:

vi  max(vi  ( F /vi), 0).

(1.2)

The update rule in equation 1.2 is a special instance of gradient projection
methods (Bertsekas, 1999; Serani, Zanghirati, & Zanni, 2005). The nonneg-
ativity constraints are enforced by projecting the gradient-based updates
in equation 1.1 onto the convex feasible setnamely, the nonnegative or-
thant vi  0. The projected gradient updates also depend on a learning rate
parameter .

For optimizations with nonnegativity constraints, an equally simple but
more appropriate learning rule involves the so-called exponentiated gradi-
ent (EG) (Kivinen & Warmuth, 1997):

vi  vi e

( F /vi ).

(1.3)

Equation 1.3 is an example of a multiplicative update. Because the elements
of the exponentiated gradient are always positive, this update naturally
enforces the nonnegativity constraints on vi. By taking the logarithm of both
sides of equation 1.3, we can view the EG update as an additive update1 in
the log domain:

log vi  log vi  ( F /vi).

(1.4)

Multiplicative updates such as EG typically lead to faster convergence
of the
than additive updates (Kivinen & Warmuth, 1997) if the solution v



1 This update differs slightly from gradient descent in the variable ui =log vi , which
would involve the partial derivative  F /ui = vi ( F /vi ) as opposed to what appears in
equation 1.4.

optimization problem is sparse, containing a large number of zero ele-
ments. Note, moreover, that sparse solutions are more likely to arise in
problems with nonnegativity constraints because in these problems, min-
=0 without the precise vanishing of the partial deriva-
ima can emerge at v
tive ( F /vi)|v (as would be required in an unconstrained optimization).
The EG update in equation 1.3, like gradient descent in equation 1.1
and projected gradient descent in equation 1.2, depends on the explicit
introduction of a learning rate  >0. The size of the learning rate must be
chosen to avoid divergent oscillations (if  is too large) and unacceptably
slow convergence (if  is too small). The necessity of choosing a learning
rate can be viewed as a consequence of the generality of these learning
rules; they do not assume or exploit any structure in the objective function
F (v) beyond the fact that it is differentiable.

Not surprisingly, many objective functions in machine learning have
structure that can be exploited in their optimizationsand in particular,
by multiplicative updates. Such updates need not involve learning rates,
and they may also involve intuitions rather different from the connection
between EG and gradient descent in equations 1.3 and 1.4. For example,
the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for latent variable models
(Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977) and the generalized iterative scaling (GIS)
algorithm for logistic regression (Darroch & Ratcliff, 1972) can be viewed as
multiplicative updates (Saul, Sha, & Lee, 2003), but unlike the EG update,
they cannot be cast as simple variants of gradient descent in the log domain.
In this article, we derive multiplicative updates for convex problems
in quadratic programming where the optimization is conned to an axis-
aligned region in the nonnegative orthant. Our multiplicative updates have
the property that they improve the value of the objective function at each
iteration and converge monotonically to the global minimum. Despite their
simplicity, they differ strikingly in form from other multiplicative updates
used in statistical learning, including EG, EM, and GIS. This article provides
a complete derivation and proof of convergence for the multiplicative up-
dates, originally described in previous work (Sha, Saul, & Lee, 2003a, 2003b).
The proof techniques should be of general interest to researchers in neural
computation and statistical learning faced with problems in constrained
optimization.

The basic problem that we study in this article is quadratic programming

with nonnegativity constraints:

minimize
subject to

2 vTAv + bTv

F (v) = 1
v  0.

(1.5)

The constraint indicates that the variable v is conned to the nonnegative
orthant. We assume that the matrix A is symmetric and strictly positive
denite, so that the objective function F (v) in equation 1.5 is bounded below,

and its optimization is convex. In particular, it has one global minimum and
no local minima.

Monotonically convergent multiplicative updates for minimizing equa-
tion 1.5 were previously developed for the special case of nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF) (Lee & Seung, 2001). In this setting, the matrix
elements of A are nonnegative, and the vector elements of b are negative.
The updates for NMF are derived from an auxiliary function similar to the
one used in EM algorithms. They take the simple, elementwise multiplica-
tive form,
vi 

(cid:1) |bi|

(1.6)

(cid:2)

vi ,

(Av)i

which is guaranteed to preserve the nonnegativity constraints on v. The
validity of these updates for NMF hinges on the assumption that the matrix
elements of A are nonnegative: otherwise, the denominator in equation 1.6
could become negative, leading to a violation of the nonnegativity con-
straints on v.

In this article, we generalize the multiplicative updates in equation 1.6 to
a wider range of problems in nonnegative quadratic programming (NQP).
Our updates assume only that the matrix A is positive semidenite: in par-
ticular, it may have negative elements off the diagonal, and the vector b
may have both positive and negative elements. Despite the greater gener-
ality of our updates, they retain a simple, elementwise multiplicative form.
The multiplicative factors in the updates involve only two matrix-vector
multiplications and reduce to equation 1.6 for the special case of NMF. The
updates can also be extended in a straightforward way to the more general
problem of NQP with upper-bound constraints on the variable v  (cid:1). Under
these additional constraints, the variable v is restricted to an axis-aligned
box in the nonnegative orthant with opposing vertices at the origin and
the nonnegative vector (cid:1).

We prove that our multiplicative updates converge monotonically to
the global minimum of the objective function for NQP. The proof relies on
constructing an auxiliary function, as in earlier proofs for EM and NMF al-
gorithms (Dempster et al., 1977; Lee & Seung, 2001). In general, monotonic
improvement in an auxiliary function sufces only to establish convergence
to a local stationary point, not necessarily a global minimum. For our up-
dates, however, we are able to prove global convergence by exploiting the
particular structure of their xed points as well as the convexity of the
objective function.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In section 2, we present
the multiplicative updates and develop some simple intuitions behind their
form. The updates are then derived more formally and their convergence
properties established in section 3, which completes the proofs sketched
in earlier work (Sha et al., 2003a, 2003b). In section 4, we briey describe

some applications to problems in signal processing (Lin et al., 2004) and
pattern recognition (Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor, 2000). Finally, in section 5,
we conclude by summarizing the main advantages of our approach.

2 Algorithm

We begin by presenting the multiplicative updates for the basic problem
of NQP in equation 1.5. Some simple intuitions behind the updates are
developed by analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for this
problem. We then extend the multiplicative updates to handle the more
general problem of NQP with additional upper-bound constraints v  (cid:1).

2.1 Updates for NQP. The multiplicative updates for NQP are ex-
pressed in terms of the positive and negative components of the matrix A.

In particular, let A
denote the nonnegative matrices with elements:

It follows that A = A
. In terms of these nonnegative matrices, the
objective function in equation 1.5 can be decomposed as the combination
of three terms, which we write as
F (v) = Fa (v) + Fb(v)  Fc(v)

(2.2)

for reasons that will become clear shortly. We use the rst and third terms
in equation 2.2 to split the quadratic piece of F (v) and the second term to
capture the linear piece:

Fa (v) = 1
+
2 vTA
Fb(v) = bTv,
Fc(v) = 1

v.

(2.3)

The decomposition (see equation 2.2) follows trivially from the denitions
in equations 2.1 and 2.3. The gradient of F (v) can be similarly decomposed
in terms of contributions from these three pieces. We have chosen our
notation in equation 2.3 so that bi =  Fb /vi; for the quadratic terms in the
objective function, we dene the corresponding derivatives:

(2.5)

Note that the partial derivatives in equations 2.4 and 2.5 are guaranteed to
be nonnegative when evaluated at vectors v in the nonnegative orthant. The
multiplicative updates are expressed in terms of these partial derivatives as

(2.6)

Note that these updates reduce to the special case of equation 1.6 for NMF
when the matrix A has no negative elements.

The updates in equation 2.6 are meant to be applied in parallel to all the
elements of v. They are remarkably simple to implement and notable for
their absence of free parameters or heuristic criteria that must be tuned to
ensure convergence. Since ai 0 and ci 0, it follows that the multiplicative
prefactor in equation 2.6 is always nonnegative; thus, the optimization
remains conned to the feasible region for NQP. As we show in section 3,
moreover, these updates are guaranteed to decrease the value of F (v) at
each iteration.

There is a close link between the sign of the partial derivative  F /vi
and the effect of the multiplicative update on vi . In particular, using the fact
that  F /vi = ai +bi ci, it is easy to show that the update decreases vi if
 F /vi >0 and increases vi if  F /vi <0. Thus, the multiplicative update in
equation 2.6 moves each element vi in an opposite direction to its partial
derivative.

2.2 Fixed Points. Further intuition for the updates in equation 2.6
can be gained by examining their xed points. Let mi denote the mul-
tiplicative prefactor inside the brackets on the right-hand side of equa-
tion 2.6. Fixed points of the updates occur when either (1) vi =0 or
(2) mi =1. What does the latter condition imply? Note that the expression
for mi is simply the quadratic formula for the larger root of the polynomial
p(m) = ai m2+bi mci . Thus, mi =1 implies that ai +bi ci = 0. From the def-
initions in equations 2.2 to 2.5, moreover, it follows that  F /vi = 0. Thus,
the two criteria for xed points can be restated as (1) vi =0 or (2)  F /vi =0.
These are consistent with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for
the NQP problem in equation 1.5, as we now show.

Let i denote the Lagrange multiplier used to enforce the nonnegativity

constraint on vi. The KKT conditions are given by
  v = 0,

Av + b = ,

  0,

v  0,

(2.7)

2010

in which  stands for elementwise vector multiplication. A necessary and
sufcient condition for v to solve equation 1.5 is that there exists a vec-
tor  such that v and  satisfy this system. It follows from equation 2.7
that the gradient of F (v) at its minimum is nonnegative: F = Av + b  0.
Moreover, for inactive constraints (corresponding to elements of the mini-
mizer that are strictly positive), the corresponding partial derivatives of the
objective function must vanish:  F /vi = 0 if vi > 0. Thus, the KKT condi-
tions imply that (1) vi = 0 or (2)  F /vi = 0, and any solution satisfying the
KKT conditions corresponds to a xed point of the multiplicative updates,
though not vice versa.

2.3 Upper-Bound Constraints. The multiplicative updates in equation
2.6 can also be extended to incorporate upper-bound constraints of the form
v (cid:1). A simple way of enforcing such constraints is to clip the output of the
updates in equation 2.6:

(cid:6)

(2.8)

As we show in the next section, this clipped update is also guaranteed to
decrease the objective function F (v) in equation 1.5 if it results in a change
of vi.

3 Convergence Analysis

In this section, we prove that the multiplicative updates in equation 2.6 con-
verge monotonically to the global minimum of the objective function F (v).
Our proof is based on the derivation of an auxiliary function that provides
an upper bound on the objective function. Similar techniques have been
used to establish the convergence of many algorithms in statistical learn-
ing (e.g., the EM algorithm, Dempster et al., 1977, for maximum likelihood
estimation) and nonnegative matrix factorization (Lee & Seung, 2001). The
proof is composed of two parts. We rst show that the multiplicative up-
dates monotonically decrease the objective function F (v). Then we show
that the updates converge to the global minimum. We assume throughout
the article that the matrix A is positive denite such that the objective func-
tion is convex. (Though theorem 2 does not depend on this assumption,
convexity is used to establish the stronger convergence results that follow.)

3.1 Monotonic Convergence. An auxiliary function G(u, v) for the ob-
jective function in equation 1.5 has two crucial properties: (1) F (u) G(u, v)
and (2) F (v)= G(v, v) for all positive vectors u and v. From such an auxiliary

F (v). The auxiliary function is constructed around the current estimate of the
minimizer; the next estimate is found by minimizing the auxiliary function,
which provides an upper bound on the objective function. The procedure is
iterated until it converges to a stationary point (generally a local minimum) of
the objective function.

By iterating this update, we obtain a series of values of v that improve
the objective function. Figure 1 graphically illustrates how the auxiliary
function G(u, v) is used to compute a minimum of the objective function
F (v) at v = v



.

To derive an auxiliary function for NQP, we rst decompose the objective
function F (v) in equation 1.5 into three terms as in equations 2.2 and 2.3 and
then derive the upper bounds for each of them separately. The following
two lemmas establish the bounds relevant to the quadratic terms Fa (u)
and Fc(u).

As explained previously, a new estimate that improves the objective
function F (v) at its current estimate v is obtained by minimizing the aux-
iliary function G(u, v) with respect to its rst argument u, as shown by
following theorem:

Proof. The inequality in equation 3.12 is a direct result from the deni-
tion of the auxiliary function and its relation to the objective function. The

3.2 Global Convergence. The multiplicative updates dene a mapping
M from the current estimate v of the minimizer to a new estimate v
. By it-
eration, the updates generate a sequence of estimates {v1, v2, . . .}, satisfying
vk+1=M(vk). The sequence monotonically improves the objective function
F (v). Since the sequence {F (v1), F (v2), . . . ,} is monotonically decreasing
and is bounded below by the global minimum value of F (v), the sequence
converges to some value when k is taken to the limit of innity. While
establishing monotonic convergence of the sequence, however, the above
observation does not rule out the possibility that the sequence converges
to spurious xed points of the iterative procedure vk+1=M(vk) that are not
the global minimizer of the objective function. In this section, we prove
that the multiplicative updates do indeed converge to the global minimizer
and attain the global minimum of the objective function. (The technical
details of this section are not necessary for understanding how to derive or
implement the multiplicative updates.)

3.2.1 Outline of the Proof. Our proof relies on a detailed investigation of
the xed points of the mapping M dened by the multiplicative updates. In
what follows, we distinguish between the spurious xed points of M that
violate the KKT conditions versus the unique xed point of M that satises
the KKT conditions and attains the global minimum value of F (v). The basic
idea of the proof is to rule out both the possibility that the multiplicative
updates converge to a spurious xed point, as well as the possibility that
they lead to oscillations among two or more xed points.
Our proof consists of three stages. First, we show that any accumulation
point of the sequence {v1, v2, . . .} must be a xed point of the multiplica-
tive updateseither a spurious xed point or the global minimizer. Such
a result is considerably weaker than global convergence to the minimizer.
Second, we show that there do not exist convergent subsequences S of the
mapping M with spurious xed points as accumulation points. In par-
ticular, we show that if such a sequence S converges to a spurious xed
point, then it must have a subsequence converging to a different xed point,
yielding a contradiction. Therefore, the accumulation point of any conver-
gent subsequence must be the global minimizer. Third, we strengthen the
result on subsequence convergence and show that the sequence {v1, v2, . . .}
converges to the global minimizer.

Our proof starts from Zangwills convergence theorem (Zangwill, 1969),
a well-known convergence result for general iterative methods, but our
nal result does not follow simply from this general framework. We re-
view Zangwills convergence theorem in appendix A. The application of
this theorem in our setting yields the weaker result in the rst step of our
proof: convergence to a xed point of the multiplicative updates. As ex-
plained in the appendix, however, Zangwills convergence theorem does
not exclude the possibility of convergence to spurious xed points. We de-
rive our stronger result of global convergence by exploiting the particular

2016

structure of the objective function and the multiplicative update rules for
NQP. A key step (see lemma 4) in our proof is to analyze the mapping M
on sequences that are in the vicinity of spurious xed points. Our analysis
appeals repeatedly to the specic properties of the objective function and
the mapping induced by the multiplicative updates.
The following notation and preliminary observations will be useful. We
use {vk}
1 to denote
the corresponding sequence {F (v1), F (v2), . . . , F (vk), . . .}. We assume that
the matrix A in equation 1.5 is strictly positive denite so that the objective
function has a unique global minimum. From this, it also follows that the
+
matrix A
in equation 1.7 has strictly positive elements along the diagonal.

3.2.2 Positivity. Our proof will repeatedly invoke the observation that
for a strictly positive vector v, the multiplicative updates in equation 2.6
(cid:8) = M(v). There is one exception to this

rule, which we address here. Starting from a strictly positive vector v, the

multiplicative updates will set an element v(cid:8)
that bi  0 and the ith row of the matrix A has no negative elements. It
is easy to verify in this case, however, that the global minimizer v
of the
= 0. Once an element

objective function does have a zero element at v
i
in zeroed by the multiplicative updates, it remains zero under successive
updates. In effect, when this happens, the original problem in NQP reduces
to a smaller problemof dimensionality equal to the number of nontrivial
modes in the original system. Without loss of generality, therefore, we will
assume in what follows that any trivial degrees of freedom have already
been removed from the problem. More specically, we will assume that the
ith row of the matrix A has one or more negative elements whenever bi  0
and that consequently, a strictly positive vector v is always mapped to a
strictly positive vector v



(cid:8) = M(v).
3.2.3 Accumulation Points of {vk}

1 . The following lemma is a direct result
of Zangwills convergence theorem, as reviewed in appendix A. It estab-
lishes the link between the accumulation points of{vk}
1 and the xed points
of M.

Lemma 3. Given a point v1, suppose the update rule in equation 2.6 generates a
sequence {vk}
1 . Then either the algorithm terminates at a xed point of M or the
accumulation point of any convergent subsequence in {vk}
1 is a xed point of M.
Proof. If there is a k  1 such that vk is a xed point of M, then the update
rule terminates. Therefore, we consider the case that an innite sequence is
generated and show how to apply Zangwills convergence theorem.
Let M be the update procedure in Zangwills convergence theorem. We
rst verify that the sequence {vk}
1 generated by M is in a compact set.

Multiplicative Updates for Nonnegative Quadratic Programming
Because {F (vk)}
for all k,

1

is a monotonically decreasing sequence, it follows that

2017

vk   = {v|F (v)  F (v1)}.

(3.16)

Note that the set  is compact because it denes an ellipsoid conned to
the positive orthant.
We dene the desired set S to be the collection of all the xed points
of M. If v / S, then from theorem 2, we have that F (M(v)) < F (v). On the
other hand, if v  S, then we have that F (M(v)) = F (v). This shows that the
mapping M maintains strict monotonicity of the objective function outside
the desired set.
The last condition to verify is that M is closed at v if v is not in the desired
set. Note that M is continuous if v (cid:9)= 0. Therefore, if the origin v = 0 is a
xed point of M, then M is closed outside the desired set.
If the origin is not a xed point of M, then it cannot be the global
minimizer. Moreover, we can choose the initial estimate v1 such that F (v1) <
F (0). With this choice, it follows from the monotonicity of M that the origin
is not contained in  and that M is continuous on .
Either way, we have shown that M is closed on a proper domain. There-
fore, we can apply Zangwills convergence theorem to the mapping M
restricted on : the limit of any convergent subsequence in {vk}
1 is in the
desired set or equivalently, a xed point of M.

Remark. It is easy to check whether the global minimizer occurs at the
origin with value F (0)=0. In particular, if all the elements of b are nonneg-
ative, then the origin is the global minimizer. On the other hand, if there
is a nonnegative element of b, then we can choose the initial estimate v1
such that F (v1) < F (0). For example, suppose bk < 0. Then we can choose
v1 such that its kth element is  and all other elements are . A positive 
and  can be found such that F (v1) < 0 by noting

3.2.4 Properties of the Fixed Points. As stated in section 2.2, the minimizer
of F (v) satises the KKT conditions and corresponds to a xed point of the
mapping M dened by the multiplicative update rule in equation 2.6. The
mapping M, however, also has xed points that do not satisfy the KKT
conditions. We refer to these as spurious xed points.
1 must have a
xed point of M as its accumulation point. To prove that the multiplicative
updates converge to the global minimizer, we will show that spurious xed
points cannot be accumulation points. Our strategy is to demonstrate that
any subsequence S converging to a spurious xed point must itself have a
subsequence running away from the xed point. The idea of the proof is
shown schematically in Figure 2. The star in the center of the gure denotes
(cid:8)
the global minimizer v
. Black squares denote spurious xed points v and v
.
The gure also shows a hypothetical subsequence that converges to the
spurious xed point v.

At a high level, the proof (by contradiction) is as follows. Suppose that
there exists a convergent subsequence as shown in Figure 2. Then we can
draw a very small -ball around the spurious xed point v containing
an innite number of elements of the subsequence. We will show that
under the mapping M, the subsequence must have an innite number
of successors that are outside the -ball yet inside a -ball where  > .
This bounded successor sequence must have a subsequence converging
to an accumulation point, which by lemma 3 must also be a xed point.
However, we can choose the -ball to be sufciently small such that the
annulus between the -ball and -ball contains no other xed points. This
yields a contradiction.

More formally, we begin by proving the following lemma:

Lemma 4. Let v1 denote a positive initial vector satisfying F (v1) < F (0). Sup-
pose that the sequence vk+1 = M(vk) generated by the iterative update in equation
2.6 has a subsequence that converges to the spurious xed point v. Then there
exists an  > 0 and a  > 0 such that for every v (cid:9)= v such that (cid:13)v  v(cid:13) < , there
exists an integer p  1 such that  < (cid:13)Mp(v)  v(cid:13) < , where Mp(v) is p times

Proof. If v is a xed point, then either vi
is true, as shown in section 2.2, it follows that ( F /vi)|v=0. When vi = 0,
then either ( F /vi)|v0 or ( F /vi)|v <0. If v is a spurious xed point that
violates the KKT conditions, then there exists at least one i such that

(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)

vi = 0 and

<0.

v

Let v be a small ball centered at v with radius of : v = {v|(cid:13)v  v(cid:13) < }. By
continuity, there exists an  such that ( F /vi) <0 for all v  v.
Let  be the image of v under the mapping M. Since M is a continuous
mapping, we can nd a minimum ball v = {v|(cid:13)v  v(cid:13) < } to encircle .
We claim that the  and  satisfy the lemma.
As observed in section 2.2, the multiplicative update increases vi if  F /vi
is negative. Consider the sequence {M(v),M  M(v), . . . ,Mk(v), . . .}. The
ith component of the sequence is monotonically increasing until the con-
dition ( F /vi) becomes nonnegative. This happens only if the element of
the sequence is outside the v ball. Thus, for every v  v, the update will
push vi to larger and larger values until it escapes from the ball. Let p be
the smallest integer such that

Mp1(v)  v and Mp(v) / v

By construction of the v ball, Mp is inside the ball since  is the image of
the v under the mapping M and Mp1(v)  v. Therefore, Mp(v)    v.

The size of the -ball depends on the spurious xed point v and . Can v
contain another spurious xed point v
? The following lemma shows that
we can choose  sufciently small such that the ball v contains no other
xed points.

Proof. It sufces to show that M(v) becomes arbitrarily close to v as v
approaches v. Since M is a bounded and continuous mapping, the image
 of v under M becomes arbitrarily small as   0. Note that v is a xed
point of M, and we have v  . Therefore, the -ball centered at v can be
made arbitrarily small as v approaches v.
and choose (cid:8)

Let us choose  sufciently small such that  is less than the half of the

distance between v and v
v and v(cid:8) is empty. This is illustrated in Figure 2.

(cid:8)

Because the spurious xed points are separated by their -balls, we
will show that the existence of a subsequence converging to a spurious
xed point leads to a contradiction. This observation leads to the following
theorem.

Theorem 3.

If the matrix A is strictly positive denite, then no convergent
1 can have a spurious xed point of the multiplicative updates

Suppose there is a convergent subsequence{vk}  {vk}

Proof. The number of spurious xed points is nite and bounded above
by the number of ways of choosing zero elements of v. Let  > 0 be the
minimum pairwise distance between these xed points. By lemma 4, we
can choose a small  such that the radius of the -ball for any spurious xed
point is less than /2. With this choice, the -balls at different spurious
xed points are nonoverlapping.

Without loss of generality, we assume the whole subsequence is contained
in the -ball of v.
For each element vk of the subsequence, by lemma 4, there exists an
integer pk such that Mpk (vk) is outside the -ball yet inside the -ball. Con-
sider the successor sequence Mpk (vk) with k  K, schematically shown
in Figure 2 as the black circles between the -ball and the -ball. The innite
successor sequence is bounded between the -ball and -ball and therefore

must have a convergent subsequence. By lemma 3, the accumulation point
of this subsequence must be a xed point of M. However, this leads to
contradiction. On one hand, the subsequence is outside the -ball of v so v
is not the accumulation point. On the other hand, the subsequence is inside
the -ball of v: therefore, it cannot have any other spurious xed point v
as
its accumulation point, because we have shown that all pairs of xed points
are separated by their respective -balls. Therefore, the accumulation point
of the subsequence cannot be a xed point. Thus, we arrive at a contradic-
tion, showing that spurious xed points cannot be accumulation points of
any convergent subsequence.

(cid:8)

3.2.5 Convergence to the Global Minimizer. We have shown that the only
possible accumulation point of{vk}
1 is the global minimizer: the xed point
of M that satises the KKT conditions. We now show that the sequence

1 itself does indeed converge to the global minimizer.

imizer. Thus, there are no xed points in

however, is bounded, and therefore must have an accumulation point; by
lemma 3, this accumulation point must be a xed point. This yields a con-
tradiction. Hence, the set  cannot have an innite number of elements,
and the sequence {vk}

1 must converge to the global minimizer.

4 Applications

In this section, we sketch two real-world applications of the multiplicative
updates to problems in signal processing and pattern recognition. Recently,
the updates have also been applied by astrophysicists to estimate the mass
distribution of a gravitational lens and the positions of the sources from
combined strong and weak lensing data (Diego, Tegmark, Protopapas, &
Sandvik, 2007).

4.1 Acoustic Time Delay Estimation. In a reverberant acoustic envi-
ronment, microphone recordings capture echos reected from objects such
as walls and furniture in addition to the signals that propagate directly from
a sound source. As illustrated in Figure 3, the signal at the microphone x(t)
can be modeled as a linear combination of the source signal s(t) at different
delay times: s(t  t), s(t  t
). Given a received signal x(t)

) and s(t  t

and its source signal s(t), how can we identify in x(t) all the time-delayed
components of s(t)? To this end, we consider the model (Lin et al., 2004)

i s(t  ti ) with i  0,

(4.1)

x(t) = N(cid:15)

i

in which {ti}N
i=1 are all possible time delays (discretized to some nite
resolution) and {i} are the relative amplitudes (or attenuations) of the
time-delayed components. The nonnegativity constraints in equation 4.1
incorporate the assumption that only the amplitudes of acoustic waves are
affected by reections while the phases are retained (Allen & Berkley, 1979).
Within this model, the time-delayed components of s(t) can be identied by
computing the amplitudes i that best reconstruct x(t). The reconstruction
with least-squares error is obtained from the nonnegative deconvolution:

i

i s(t  ti )|2.

Nonzero weights 
in the least-squares reconstruction are interpreted as
indicating time-delayed components in the received signal with delays ti .
It is convenient to rewrite this optimization in the frequency domain.
Let x( f ) and s( f ) denote the Fourier transforms of x(t) and s(t), respec-
tively. Also, dene the positive semidenite matrix Kij and the real-valued
coefcients ci by

This has the same form as the NQP problem in equation 1.5 and can be
solved by the multiplicative updates in equation 2.6. Note that Kij denes
a Toeplitz matrix if the possible time delays ti are linearly spaced. Using
fast Fourier transforms, the Toeplitz structure of Kij can be exploited for
much faster matrix-vector operations per multiplicative update.

Figure 4: Convergence of the multiplicative updates for acoustic time delay
estimation.

Figure 4 shows the convergence of the multiplicative updates for a prob-
lem in acoustic time delay estimation. The source signal s(t) in this example
was a 30 ms window of speech, and the received signal x(t) was given by

x(t) = s(t  Ts) + 0.5 s(t  8.5Ts),

where Ts was the sampling period. The vertical axes measure the estimated
amplitudes i after different numbers of iterations of the multiplicative
updates; the horizontal axes measure the time delays ti in the units of
Ts. The vertical dashed lines indicate the delays at Ts and 8.5Ts. The gure
shows that as the number of iterations is increased, the time delays are
accurately predicted by the peaks in the estimated amplitudes i .

4.2 Large Margin Classication. Large margin classiers have been
applied successfully to many problems in machine learning and statistical
pattern recognition (Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor, 2000; Vapnik, 1998). These
classiers use hyperplanes as decision boundaries to separate positively
and negatively labeled examples represented by multidimensional vectors.
Generally the hyperplanes are chosen to maximize the minimum distance
(known as the margin) from any labeled example to the decision boundary
(see Figure 5).
Let {(xi , yi)}N
i=1 denote a data set of N labeled training examples with
binary class labels yi = 1. The simplest case, shown in Figure 5 (left),

is that the two classes are linearly separable by a hyperplane that passes
through the origin. Let w
denote the hyperplanes normal vector; the clas-
sication rule, given by y = sgn(w
Tx), labels examples based on whether
they lie above or below the hyperplane. The maximum margin hyperplane
is computed by solving the constrained optimization:

The constraints in this optimization ensure that all the training examples are
correctly labeled by the classiers decision rule. While a potentially innite
number of hyperplanes satisfy these constraints, the classier with mini-
mal||w|| (and thus maximal margin) has provably small error rates (Vapnik,
1998) on unseen examples. The optimization problem in equation 4.6 is a
convex quadratic programming problem in the vector w. Its dual formula-

For nonsupport vectors, the inequalities are strictly satised in equation 4.6,
and their corresponding Lagrange multipliers vanish (that is, 

= 0).

Figure 6 illustrates the convergence of the multiplicative updates for
large margin classication of handwritten digits (Scholkopf et al., 1997).
The plots show the estimated support vector coefcients i after different
numbers of iterations of the multiplicative updates. The horizontal axes in
these plots index the coefcients i of the N = 1389 training examples, and
the vertical axes show their values. For ease of visualization, the training
examples were ordered so that support vectors appear to the left and non-
support vectors to the right. The coefcients were uniformly initialized as
i = 1. Note that the nonsupport vector coefcients are quickly attenuated
to zero.

Multiplicative updates can also be used to train large margin classiers
when the labeled examples are not linearly separable, as shown in Figure 5
(right). In this case, the constraints in equation 4.6 cannot all be simultane-
ously satised, and some of them must be relaxed. One simple relaxation

The parameter C balances the slackness penalty versus the large margin
criterion; the resulting classiers are known as soft margin classiers. The

The clipped multiplicative updates in equation 2.8 can be used to perform
this optimization for soft margin classiers.

Another way of handling linear inseparability is to embed the data in a
high-dimensional nonlinear feature space and then to construct the maxi-
mum margin hyperplane in feature space. The nonlinear mapping is per-
formed implicitly by specifying a kernel function that computes the inner
product in feature space. The optimization for the maximum margin hy-
perplane in feature space has the same form as equation 4.7 except that
the original Gram matrix with elements xT
i x j is replaced by the kernel ma-
trix of inner products in feature space (Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor, 2000;
Vapnik, 1998). The use of multiplicative updates for large margin classi-
cation of linearly inseparable data sets is discussed further in (Sha et al.,
2003a, 2003b).

A large number of algorithms have been investigated for nonnegative
quadratic programming in SVMs. Among them, there are many criteria that
could be compared, such as speed of convergence, memory requirements,
and ease of implementation. The main utility of the multiplicative updates
appears to lie in their ease of implementation. The updates are very well
suited for applications involving small to moderately sized data sets, where
computation time is not a primary concern and where the simple, parallel
form of the updates makes them easy to implement in high-level languages
such as Matlab.

The most popular methods for training SVMsso-called subset
methodstake a fundamentally different approach to NQP. In contrast
to the parallel form of the multiplicative updates, subset methods split the
variables at each iteration into two sets: a xed set in which the variables
are held constant and a working set in which the variables are optimized

by an internal subroutine. At the end of each iteration, a heuristic is used to
transfer variables between the two sets and improve the objective function.
Two subset methods have been widely used for training SVMs. The rst
is the method of sequential minimal optimization (SMO) (Platt, 1999), which
updates only two coefcients of the weight vector per iteration. In this case,
there exists an analytical solution for the updates, so that one avoids the
expense of an iterative optimization within each iteration of the main loop.
SMO enforces the sum and box constraints for soft margin classiers. If the
sum constraint is lifted, then it is possible to update the coefcients of the
weight vector sequentially, one at a time, with an adaptive learning rate that
ensures monotonic convergence. This coordinate descent approach is also
known as the kernel Adatron (Friess, Cristianini, & Campbell, 1998). SMO
and kernel Adatron are among the most viable methods for training SVMs
on large data sets, and experiments have shown that they converge much
faster than the multiplicative updates (Sha et al., 2003b). Nevertheless, for
simplicity and ease of implementation, we believe that the multiplicative
updates provide an attractive starting point for experimenting with large
margin classiers.

5 Summary and Discussion

In this article, we have described multiplicative updates for solving convex
problems in NQP. The updates are distinguished by their simplicity in both
form and computation. We showed that the updates lead to monotonic
improvement in the objective function for NQP and converge to global
minima. The updates can be viewed as generalizations of the iterative rules
previously developed for nonnegative matrix factorization (Lee & Seung,
2001). They have a strikingly different form from other additive and multi-
plicative updates used in statistical learning.

We can also compare the multiplicative updates to interior point methods
(Wright, 1997) that have been studied for NQP. These methods start from an
interior point of the feasible region and then iteratively update the current
estimate of the minimizer along particular search directions. There are many
ways to determine the search directionsfor example, using Newtons
method to solve the equations characterizing primal and dual optimality, or
approximating the original optimization problem by a simpler subproblem
inside the trust region of the current estimate. The resulting updates take
an elementwise additive form, stepping along a particular search direction
in the nonnegative orthant. The step size is chosen to ensure that the search
remains in the feasible region while making progress toward the minimizer.
If the search direction corresponds to the negative gradient of the objective
function F (v), then the updates reduce to steepest descent. Most of the
computational effort in interior point methods is devoted to deriving search
directions and maintaining the feasibility of the updated estimates.

Multiplicative Updates for Nonnegative Quadratic Programming

2029

The multiplicative updates are similar to trust region methods in spirit.
Instead of constructing an ellipsoidal trust region centered at the current
estimate of the minimizer, however, we have derived the updates from
a nonlinear yet analytically tractable auxiliary function. Optimizing the
auxiliary function guarantees the improvement of the objective function in
the nonnegative orthant, which can be viewed as the trust region for each
update. The search direction derived from the auxiliary function is very
simple to compute, as opposed to that of many interior point methods. It
remains an open question to quantify more precisely the rate of convergence
of the multiplicative updates.

Though not as well theoretically characterized as traditional methods for
NQP, the multiplicative updates have nevertheless proven extremely useful
in practice. In this article, we have described our own use of the updates
for acoustic echo cancellation and large margin classication. Meanwhile,
others have applied the updates to NQP problems that arise in the analysis
of astrophysical data (Diego et al., 2007). We are hopeful that more appli-
cations will continue to emerge in other areas of neural computation and
statistical learning.

Appendix: Zangwills Convergence Theorem

Zangwills convergence theorem enumerates the conditions for global con-
vergence of general iterative procedures. The theorem is presented in its
most general form in Zangwill (1969). For our purposes here, we speci-
cally state the theorem in the context of optimization. Let F (v) denote the
objective function to be minimized by an iterative update rule vk+1 = M(vk),
where the domain and range of the mapping M : V  V lie in the feasible
set. Suppose that we apply the mapping M to generate a sequence of pa-
rameters {vk}
k=1. Our goal is to examine whether this sequence converges
to a point in a desired set V  V. Assume that the objective function F (v)
and the mapping M are continuous and that the following conditions are
met:

1. All points vk are in a compact set that is a subset of V.
2. If v / V
3. If v  V

, then the update leads to a strict reduction in the objective
, then either M(v) = v or F (M(v))  F (v).

function. That is, F (M(v)) < F (v).

Zangwills convergence theorem states that under these conditions, either
the sequence {vk}
, or all accumulation points
of the sequence are in the set V

k=1 stops at a point in the set V

.

The theorem can be used to analyze the convergence of iterative up-
date rules by verifying that these three conditions hold for particular de-
sired sets. For the multiplicative updates in equation 2.6, the theorem
implies convergence to a xed point v = M(v). It does not, however, imply

convergence to the unique xed point that is the global minimizer of the
objective function. In particular, if we constrain V
to contain only the global
minimizer, then condition (2), which stipulates that F (v) strictly decreases
under the mapping M for all V / V
, is clearly violated due to the existence
of spurious xed points. The proof of global convergence thus requires
the extra machinery of section 3.2.
