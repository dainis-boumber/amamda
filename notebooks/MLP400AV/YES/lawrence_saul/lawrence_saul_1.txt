Abstract
High dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold can be described by a collection of
local linear models. Such a description, however, does not provide a global parameterization of the
manifoldarguably an important goal of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we show how to learn a
collection of local linear models that solves this more difficult problem. Our local linear models are
represented by a mixture of factor analyzers, and the global coordination of these models is achieved by
adding a regularizing term to the standard maximum likelihood objective function. The regularizer breaks a
degeneracy in the mixture models parameter space, favoring models whose internal coordinate systems are
aligned in a consistent way. As a result, the internal coordinates change smoothly and continuously as one
traverses a connected path on the manifoldeven when the path crosses the domains of many different local
models. The regularizer takes the form of a Kullback-Leibler divergence and illustrates an unexpected
application of variational methods: not to perform approximate inference in intractable probabilistic models,
but to learn more useful internal representations in tractable ones.

Abstract

High dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold can be de-
scribed by a collection of local linear models. Such a description, however, does
not provide a global parameterization of the manifoldarguably an important
goal of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we show how to learn a collection
of local linear models that solves this more difcult problem. Our local linear
models are represented by a mixture of factor analyzers, and the global coordi-
nation of these models is achieved by adding a regularizing term to the standard
maximum likelihood objective function. The regularizer breaks a degeneracy
in the mixture models parameter space, favoring models whose internal coor-
dinate systems are aligned in a consistent way. As a result, the internal coor-
dinates change smoothly and continuously as one traverses a connected path on
the manifoldeven when the path crosses the domains of many different local
models. The regularizer takes the form of a Kullback-Leibler divergence and
illustrates an unexpected application of variational methods: not to perform ap-
proximate inference in intractable probabilistic models, but to learn more useful
internal representations in tractable ones.

1 Manifold Learning

Consider an ensemble of images, each of which contains a face against a neutral back-
ground. Each image can be represented by a point in the high dimensional vector space
of pixel intensities. This representation, however, does not exploit the strong correlations
between pixels of the same image, nor does it support many useful operations for reasoning
about faces. If, for example, we select two images with faces in widely different locations
and then average their pixel intensities, we do not obtain an image of a face at their average
location. Images of faces lie on or near a low-dimensional, curved manifold, and we can
represent them more usefully by the coordinates on this manifold than by pixel intensi-
ties. Using these intrinsic coordinates, the average of two faces is another face with the
average of their locations, poses and expressions.

To analyze and manipulate faces, it is helpful to imagine a magic black box with levers
or dials corresponding to the intrinsic coordinates on this manifold. Given a setting of the
levers and dials, the box generates an image of a face. Given an image of a face, the box
deduces the appropriate setting of the levers and dials. In this paper, we describe a fairly
general way to construct such a box automatically from an ensemble of high-dimensional
vectors. We assume only that there exists an underlying manifold of low dimensionality
and that the relationship between the raw data and the manifold coordinates is locally linear
and smoothly varying. Thus our method applies not only to images of faces, but also to
many other forms of highly distributed perceptual and scientic data (e.g., spectrograms of
speech, robotic sensors, gene expression arrays, document collections).

2 Local Linear Models

The global structure of perceptual manifolds (such as images of faces) tends to be highly
nonlinear. Fortunately, despite their complicated global structure, we can usually char-
acterize these manifolds as locally linear. Thus, to a good approximation, they can be
represented by collections of simpler models, each of which describes a locally linear
neighborhood[3, 6, 8]. For unsupervised learning tasks, a probabilistic model that nicely
captures this intuition is a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA)[5]. The model is used to
describe high dimensional data that lies on or near a lower dimensional manifold. MFAs

Optimization of the objective function in eq. (9) is reminiscent of so-called variational

In these methods, an approximation to an exact

two distributions. The auxiliary parameters of the approximating distribution are known
as variational parameters. Our objective function illustrates an unexpected application of
such variational methods: not to perform approximate inference in intractable probabilistic
models, but to learn more useful internal representations in tractable ones. We introduce the

6 Discussion
Mixture models provide a simple way to approximate the density of high dimensional data
that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold. However, their hidden representations
do not make explicit the relationship between dissimilar data vectors. In this paper, we
have shown how to learn global coordinates that can act as an encapsulating interface, so
that other parts of a learning system do not need to interact with the individual compo-
nents of a mixture. This should improve generalization as well as facilitate the propagation
and exchange of information when these models are incorporated into a larger (perhaps

Two variants of our purely unsupervised proposal are possible. The rst is to use an em-
bedding algorithm (such as LLE or Isomap) not only as an initialization step but to provide
clamped values for the global coordinates. While this supervised approach may work in
practice, unsupervised coordination makes clear the objective function that is being opti-

mized, which unies the goals of manifold learning and density estimation. Another variant
is to train an unsupervised mixture model (such as a MFA) using a traditional maximum
likelihood objective function and then to post-coordinate its parameters by applying local
reections/rotations and translations to create global coordinates. As illustrated in gure 4,
however, this two-step procedure can go awry because of noise in the original training set.
When both density estimation and coordination are optimized simultaneously there is extra
pressure for local experts to t the global structure of the manifold.

Our work can be viewed as a synthesis of two long lines of research in unsupervised
learning.
In the rst are efforts at learning the global structure of nonlinear manifolds
[1, 4, 9, 10]; in the second are efforts at developing probabilistic graphical models for rea-
soning under uncertainty[5, 6, 7]. Our work proposes to model the global coordinates on
manifolds as latent variables, thus attempting to combine the representational advantages
of both frameworks. It differs from embedding by providing a fully probabilistic model
valid away from the training set, and from work in generative topographic mapping[2] by
not requiring a uniform discretized gridding of the latent space. Moreover, by extending
the usefulness of mixture models,it further develops an architecture that has already proved
quite powerful and enormously popular in applications of statistical learning.
