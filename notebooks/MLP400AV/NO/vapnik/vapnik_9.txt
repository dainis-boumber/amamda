Abstract We study the use of support vector machines
(SVMs) in classifying e-mail as spam or nonspam by comparing
it to three other classication algorithms: Ripper, Rocchio, and
boosting decision trees. These four algorithms were tested on two
different data sets: one data set where the number of features
were constrained to the 1000 best features and another data set
where the dimensionality was over 7000. SVMs performed best
when using binary features. For both data sets, boosting trees
and SVMs had acceptable test performance in terms of accuracy
and speed. However, SVMs had signicantly less training time.

I. INTRODUCTION

WE DEFINE spam as an e-mail message that is un-

wantedbasically it is the electronic version of junk
mail that is delivered by the postal service. One of the reasons
for the proliferation of spam is that bulk e-mail is very cheap to
send and although it is possible to build lters that reject e-mail
if it is from a known spammer, it is easy to obtain alternative
sending addresses. Good online sources and information about
spam include http://spam.abuse.net, http://www.cauce.org, and
http://www.junke-mail.org. There have been various attempts
to use learning machines that classify e-mail [1], [2].

Solutions to the proliferation of spam are either technical or
regulatory [3]. Technical solutions include ltering based on
sender address or header content. The problem with ltering
is that sometimes a valid message may be blocked. Thus, it is
not our intent to automatically reject e-mail that is classied
as spam. Rather, we envision the following scenario: in the
training mode, users will mark their e-mail as either spam
or nonspam. After a nite number of examples are collected,
the learning machine will be trained and the performance on
new examples predicted. The user can then invoke the e-mail
classier immediately or wait until the number of examples
is enough such that performance is acceptable. After the
training mode is complete, new e-mail will be classied as
spam or nonspam. In one presentation mode, a set of new e-
mail messages is presented in a manner consistent with the
time of delivery and the spam messages color-coded. It is
then up to the user to either read the e-mail or trash the e-
mail. An alternative presentation mode is to deliver e-mail to
the user in decreasing order of probability that the e-mail is
nonspam. That is, e-mail with high probability (according to

the classier) of being nonspam is at the top of the list. In
either of these modes, the lter does not reject any messages,
only indicates whether the message has a high priority of being
spam.

It is highly desirable that if the user decides that e-mail
messages be rank-ordered by degree of condence that the
rank ordering be reliable. By reliable, we mean that the user
can either start at the top of the list of e-mail messages
and be fairly condent that they represent nonspam messages
or start at the bottom of the list and be condent that the
messages are spam. It is only near the middle of the list
(low condence) that it is reasonable to the user that a few
nonspam or spam messages may be misclassied. Therefore,
it is important that our learning algorithm not only classify
the messages correctly but that a measure of condence is
associated with that classication so that the message can be
rank ordered.

In the next section a number of design choices are outlined.
In Section III we describe the data sets and experiments. In
Section IV, we show how variation of the one parameter in
SVMs changes performance. The conclusions are presented
in Section V.

II. DESIGN CHOICES

A. Feature Representation

A feature is a word. In the development below,

refers
is a feature vector that is composed of the
to a word,
various words from a dictionary formed by analyzing the
refers
documents. There is one feature vector per message.
to a weight vector usually obtained from some combination
s. There are various alternatives and enhancements in
of the
constructing the

vectors. We consider some of them:

 TFTerm Frequency: The th component of the feature
appears in that
vector is the number of times that word
document. In our case, a word is a feature only if it occurs
in three or more documents. (This prevents misspelled
words and words used rarely from appearing in the
dictionary). Sometimes the feature vector is normalized
to unit length.

 TF-IDF uses the above TF multiplied by the IDF (inverse
)
document frequency). The document frequency (DF
occurs in all the
is the number of times that word
documents (excluding words that occur in less than three
documents). The inverse document frequency (IDF) is
dened as

IDF

DRUCKER et al.: SVMS FOR SPAM CATEGORIZATION

1049

where
is the number of documents. Typically, the
feature vector that consists of the TF-IDF entries is
normalized to unit length.

 Binary representation which indicates whether a particular
word occurs in a particular document. A word is a
candidate only if it occurs in three or more documents.

 Use of a stop list in addition to any of the above: Words
like of, and, the, etc., are used to form a stop list.
Words on the stop list are not used in forming a feature
vector. The rationale for this is that common words are
not very useful in classication. The argument against
using a stop list is that it is not obvious which words,
beyond the trivial, should be on the stop list. It may be
obvious that articles like a, an, should be on the stop
list. However, should a word like now be on the stop
list? The choice of words to put on a stop list is probably a
function of the classication task and it would be better if
learning algorithm itself determined whether a particular
word is important or not. Use of word stemming: words
such as build, builder, and building are shortened
to the word stem build. This lowers the size of the
feature vector but it may be the case that certain forms
of a word (such as the active tense) may be important in
classication.

B. Number of Features

The choice is between using some of the features or all
of the features. In text recognition, a feature is a word. One
possible advantage of using a nite number of features is better
generalization. By generalization we mean that good perfor-
mance on the training set generalizes to good performance on
a separate test set. Depending on the learning algorithm, it
may be the case that there is an optimum set of features, less
than the total number of available features. For example, if
the dimensionality of the classication space is greater than
the number of examples, then the examples may always be
separable by a nonunique hyperplane with zero training error
(assuming the patterns are independent). Since there are, in
general, an innite number of separating hyperplanes, one does
not obtain the optimal separating hyperplane (the one that has
the best test performance).

A few of the mechanisms designed to nd the optimum
number of features (and the best features) are [4] document
frequency thresholding, information gain, mutual information,
. In comparing two learning algorithms,
term strength, and
Yang and Petersen found that, except for mutual information
gain, all these feature selection methods had similar perfor-
mance and similar characteristics. That is, as the number of
features used was decreased from all the features to some
smaller number, the test performance improved. Then, once
the number of features decreased below a critical value, the
test error rate increased.

Thorsten Joachims [5] did similar experiments and com-
pared ve learning algorithms including nave Bayes, Rocchio,
-nearest neighbors, C4.5 [6] and SVMs. He found that,
except for SVM and Bayes, the optimum number of features
was less than the total number of features. For SVM, using

all the features gave better performance than any of the other
techniques.

The main disadvantage of searching for the best features
is that it requires additional time in the training algorithm. In
the case of information gain and mutual information gain, the
features are ranked by the feature selection method from high
to low, which is linear in the number of examples and linear
in the number of features (giving quadratic complexity). Then,
to nd the optimum number of features, one must apply the
learning algorithms to different set sizes to nd the minimum
error rate. Thus the complexity of the algorithm to nd the
optimum number of features is at least quadratic times the
complexity of the learning algorithm. It would be far better if
the learning machine itself either made the feature selection
automatically or used all the features. C4.5 has the former
characteristic while SVMs have the latter.

C. Performance Criteria

 Recall and Precision: In information retrieval tasks, docu-
ments could be assigned multiple categories. For instance,
a story about the high wages of baseball players could be
categorized as belonging to both the term nancial and
the term sports. When there are multiple categories,
performance measures such as recall and precision [4]
are used

recall

precision

categories found and correct

total categories correct

categories found and correct

total categories found

Since our problem is a two-class classication task, recall
and precision are not needed here.

 Error Rate: Error rate is the typical performance measure
for two-class classication schemes. However, two learn-
ing algorithms can have the same error rate, but the one
which groups the errors near the decision border is the
better one.

 False Alarm and Miss Rate: We dene the false alarm

and miss rates as

miss rate

false alarm rate

nonspam samples misclassied

total nonspam examples
spam samples misclassied

total spam examples

The advantage of the false alarm and miss rates is that
that they are a good indicator of whether the errors are
close to the decision border or not. Given two classiers
with the same error rate, the one with lower false alarm
and miss rates is the better one.

We x the miss rate and try to nd the algorithm that
minimizes the false alarm rate for that xed miss rate. These
rates will correspond to the error rates averaged using ten-fold
cross validation. In ten-fold cross validation, the entire set of
examples is divided into ten approximately equal sets. Nine
of the ten parts are using for training, one of the ten parts is
used for testing. This is repeated ten times, each time using
another test set. The total misses and false alarms are counted
and divided by ten times the number of test examples. This

1050

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOL. 10, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 1999

is more accurate than averaging the ten false alarms and miss
rates.

Recall that that even if an input message is mistakenly
misclassied as spam when it is not, it is still presented to
the user for the ultimate decision.

D. Training and Classication Speed

The e-mail server may be a unit on which many users have
an account. Therefore, the training time must be reasonable
and the classication speed must be fast. Generally, this leaves
out neural networks which take extensive time for training. We
therefore tried the following four algorithms: boosting (using
decision trees), Ripper, Rocchio, and linear SVMs. The rst
two are nonlinear learning algorithms but can be very fast in
execution and the last two are linear.

E. Choice of Learning Algorithms

1) Boosting Algorithms: The boosting algorithms (Fig. 1)
are techniques to combine a number of weak learners to form
an ensemble. The term weak leaner arrives from the PAC
(probably approximately correct) [7], [8] learning community
and indicates that the learning algorithm can learn with error
rate slightly better than 50%. C4.5 classication trees are
candidate weak learners even though their error rates can
be much better than 50%. This version of boosting works
as following: train the rst member of the ensemble with
training samples. In order to train the next member of
the ensemble, the probability that a training sample will be
picked to train the second member of the ensemble is adjusted
upwards for hard examples and down for easy examples.
By hard examples, we mean those examples that the rst weak
learner misclassies.

Each member of the ensemble is subsequently trained on
examples picked from the original
training set with their
probabilities adjusted upwards or downwards depending on
whether the previous members of the ensemble classied the
training pattern incorrectly or correctly, respectively.

For our weak learner, we use classication trees built using
a version of C4.5. Because classication trees can build dis-
connected decision regions, they are nonlinear. Classication
trees can be very fast in execution. An advantage of C4.5 is
that features are picked as part of the training algorithm and
therefore there is no need to rank order the features by some
other mechanism (like mutual information) rst. C4.5 decision
trees are built by examining a measure related to information
gain and this can be time consuming because it has to be
done multiple times (equal to the number of nodes in a tree).
Boosting has been shown to drive the error rate far below that
of one weak learner. Both the boosting algorithms itself and
the building of decision trees make training long unless there
is a small number of trees in the ensemble. However, there
is no way to predict in advance how many trees should be in
the ensemble.

In Fig. 1 WeakLearn refers in our case to a C4.5 type
algorithm. When the distribution is recalculated, a typical
method of picking a training set for this member of the
ensemble is as follows.

It is also important to note that in calculating

training examples are used in that calculation even if they
were all not used in training.

2) Support Vector Machines: SVMs are discussed exten-
sively in this issue. Also see [9][11]. The key concepts

or equivalently

Training examples that satisfy the equality are termed support
vectors. The support vectors dene two hyperplanes, one
that goes through the support vectors of one class and one
goes through the support vectors of the other class. The
distance between the two hyperplanes denes a margin [10]
and this margin is maximized when the norm of the weight
is minimum. Vapnik has shown we may perform

techniques, some of which are particular to SVMs [12], [13].
The advantage of linear SVMs is that execution speed
is very fast and there are no parameters to tune except the

is remarkably independent of the choice of

are remarkably intolerant of the relative sizes of the number
of training examples of the two classes. In most learning
algorithms, if there are many more examples of one class
than another, the algorithm will tend to correctly classify the

as long as

class with the larger number of examples, thereby driving
down the error rate. Since SVMs are not directly trying to
minimize the error rate, but trying to separate the patterns in
high dimensional space, the result is that SVMs are relatively
insensitive to the relative numbers of each class. For instance,
new examples that are far behind the hyperplanes do not
change the support vectors. The possible disadvantages of
SVMs are that the training time can be very large if there are
large numbers of training examples and execution can be slow
for nonlinear SVMs, neither of these cases being present here.
3) Ripper: Ripper is a program for inducing classication
rules from a set of examples. Unlike the other algorithms, it
does not need a feature vector. It forms ifthen rules which
are disjunctions of conjunctions, e.g.,

A document

is considered to be spam if and only if

(word FREE appears in ) OR
(word low appears in AND word cost appears in )
OR
.
.
(word !!!! appears in ).

Ripper [14] works by adding rules to cover positive exam-
ples and then prunes those rules to form a best t to a separate
pruning set. The advantages of Ripper are as follows.

 The ifthen clauses are easy for humans to understand.
 Ripper is very fast in training and testing.
 Ripper allows users to supply prior knowledge con-

straints.

 Ripper allows values to be nominal, continuous, or set-

valued.

 Ripper is nonlinear.
4) Rocchio: This type of classier [15], [16] uses normal-
ized TF-IDF representation of the training vectors. A prototype

negative are set to zero and then
Classication is performed by the dot product of the prototype
vector and the candidate test vector. Those with large positive
dot products are spam and those with large negative values are
nonspam. Unlike any of the algorithms discussed previously,
there is no natural threshold for the dot product. That is, the
algorithm does not tell us for what values above a critical
value of the dot product should we classify the document as
spam. This critical value must be obtained by rank ordering
the outputs of dot products of the prototype vector with all the
training vectors and nding that critical value that minimizes
the training error. We emphasize that the test vectors should
not be used to nd that threshold. Similarly, the optimum value
should not be obtained from the test set. It should be
of
that minimizes

the training error. The advantage of Rocchios algorithm is
that it is fast in training and testing. The disadvantage is that

one has to search for the optimum threshold and the optimum
on the training set which takes extra training time and does

not necessarily generalize well to the test set.

Further text categorization methods may be found in [17]

and [18].

III. DATA SETS

We used two data sets. Data set I was collected by an
AT&T staff member and consists of 850 messages that he
considered spam and 2150 messages that were nonspam. All
e-mail messages consist of a subject and body and the various
algorithms were tried on either the subject alone, the body
alone, or the subject and body together. In addition, a stop list
was either used or not used and all words were converted
to lower case. The 1000 best features in each case were
used (ranked using mutual information). The original feature
entries are TF (term frequency) and could later be converted
to TF-IDF or binary features.

Thus there were six data sets constructed from the original

3000 messages:

 bodnostopwords from the body only without using a

stop list.

 bodstopwords from the body only and the stop list was

used.

 subbodnostopwords from the subject and body without

using a stop list

 subbodstopwords from the subject and body using a

stop list.

 subnostopwords form the subject without using a stop

list.

 substopwords from the subject using a stop list.
Results are shown in Table I. It can therefore be seen that
the smallest error rates are given by using the subject and
body without using a stop list (subbodnostop) and that SVM
should be used with binary features. To put the error rates in
context, it should be noted that the test sample size is 300
and thus a difference of approximately 0.003 can be attributed
to a numerical difference of one error per run of the ten-
fold cross validation error rate estimate. Thus there is not
much difference on subbodnostop between SVM using binary
features and boosting. It should be emphasized that the spam
lter will never actually reject any messages classied as spam.
The use of the false alarm and miss rates is a mechanism to
compare performance.

The second data set was collected from members of the
AT&T technical staff who forwarded their spam and nonspam

to the authors. Since the spam had already passed through
the AT&T rewall, it would be expected that the spam would
be harder to classify. There were 314 spam and 303 nonspam
messages. Rather than limiting the feature vector to a nite size
we used all words in the messages as long as they occurred in
at least three messages. Furthermore, stemming was not used.
Ripper was unable to achieve either a 5% or 1% miss rate.

This data set had two versions. In Version I (Table II), words
that were all capitals were retained but words that were a
mixture of upper and lower case were translated to lower case.
The rationale for this is that we could conjecture that words
like FREE would more likely to occur in spam than words
like free. Thus, these two words would be two separate
features in this version of the database. Furthermore the word
free if it occurred in the subject at least three times and the
body at least three times would be two separate features. The
net result is that the feature vector of Version I was of size
7458.

Once again, use of binary features is preferred for SVM and
boosting give approximately equal performance if performance
is based on raw error rate. With approximately 60 messages
in the test set, one error corresponds to a numerical difference
of 0.016 67. As pointed out previously, the false alarm rates
give a measure of dispersion of the errors. Therefore, on this
basis although boosting and SVM using binary features are
comparable in error rate performance, SVM is much better in
terms of dispersion of errors.

TABLE IV

TABLE V

In Version II of this data set, all words were converted
to lower case which lowered the dimensionality to 6577.
The results for this data set are shown in Table III. First,
in comparing Tables II and III, we see that
there is no
advantage in keeping words that are all upper case. Second,
it appears that once again, it is better to use binary features
with SVM machines. Finally, although boosting has the better
performance in terms of raw error rate, the spread of errors is
better using SVM with binary features.

Operating points other than the false alarm rate due to a
xed miss rate may be of interest. Therefore, in Table IV,
we present the miss rate due a xed false alarm rate and
the operating point where the false alarm rates and miss rate
are equal (last column). These results are consistent with the
conclusions reach previously, namely that boosting is superior
in terms of test error rate but that SVM is better in terms of
the spread of errors.

The running times for training and testing have not been
optimized for either boosting machines or SVMs. However,
since the SVM only has to execute one dot product, it would
be expected to be faster than boosting C4.5 decision trees.
Both have acceptable speeds, in the order of milliseconds for
boosting decision trees and microseconds for SVM. This does
not include the time to parse a message to build up its feature
set. However, there is a remarkable difference in training time
for trees against that of SVMs. In our research version of these
algorithms, boosting trees take hours to train and SVMs, in
the order of minutes. The average tree size for this database is
approximately 11 trees which take inordinately long to build.
Thus based on a combination of training time and performance,
SVMs are superior.

There are two reasons we believe that the training time for
SVMs with binary features can be reduced. The rst is that the
vectors are binary and the second is that the feature vectors are
sparse (typically only 4% of a vector is nonzero). This allows
the dot product in the SVM optimization to be replaced with
faster nonmultiplicative routines.

affects performance for the cases
where the training data is not separable by a linear SVM. In
general there is an optimum value of this constant. However,
cannot be obtained be examining the
this best value of
training data and it is unfair to do so by examining the test data.
Only by having a third set of data, a validation set, would it be

. In that case, one would maximize
using the training set, and then nd the performance on
and repeat
the validation set. Then one would pick another
until the performance on the validation set is optimum. One
could then use the test set to nd the nal performance. Even
if we had the luxury of using a validation set, this iterative
process would take took long.

However, it is illustrative to see what happens if we tune
using the test data (Tables V and VI). We see that as

is decreased, the number of support vectors increases and the
number of the support vectors that have maximum increases.
However, for the binary case, the performance degrades while
for the TF features case, the performance improves and then
is lowered. The results seem to indicate that
degrades as
one can obtain almost equivalent performance by using the
on the TF formatted data. However, in that case
correct
we must spend time searching for that optimum, while for the
binary features, that is not the case. Furthermore, there is a
that gives equivalent performance on the
wide variation in
binary data.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Based on examining a number of data sets, different feature
representation, and different learning algorithms, we come to
the following conclusions.

1) For the best case (all words converted to lower case),
SVMs (using binary features) and boosting (using TF
features) are the two best candidates. Boosting has a
lower error rate but the dispersion of errors is better
using SVMs.

1054

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOL. 10, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 1999

2) In a choice of between using a stop list and not using a

stop list, it is preferable that a stop list not be used.

3) Based on a review of the literature, all the features
should be used rather than a subset. The literature seems
to indicate that there is an optimum set of features that
depends on both the data and the algorithm. However,
searching for the best features takes an unacceptable
period of time. Boosting using C4.5 decision trees
implicitly uses a choice of best features as part of the
algorithm and SVM performance does not degrade if
too many features are used.

4) Training time using boosting decision trees is inordi-

nately long.

It should be remembered that these performance gures are
based on data sets collected from different individuals. When
an individual marks his or her own e-mail, then the from eld
of the message can be used. This can improve the accuracy in
at least two ways: the user can generate a list of acceptable
senders that is always noted as nonspam no matter what the
subject and body contents. Furthermore, return e-mail that is a
response to a user query will always be accepted as nonspam.
