Abstract

We introduce supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), a statistical model of
labelled documents. The model accommodates a variety of response types. We
derive a maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation, which relies on
variational approximations to handle intractable posterior expectations. Prediction
problems motivate this research: we use the tted model to predict response values
for new documents. We test sLDA on two real-world problems: movie ratings
predicted from reviews, and web page popularity predicted from text descriptions.
We illustrate the benets of sLDA versus modern regularized regression, as well
as versus an unsupervised LDA analysis followed by a separate regression.

1 Introduction

There is a growing need to analyze large collections of electronic text. The complexity of document
corpora has led to considerable interest in applying hierarchical statistical models based on what are
called topics. Formally, a topic is a probability distribution over terms in a vocabulary. Informally,
a topic represents an underlying semantic theme; a document consisting of a large number of words
might be concisely modelled as deriving from a smaller number of topics. Such topic models provide
useful descriptive statistics for a collection, which facilitates tasks like browsing, searching, and
assessing document similarity.
Most topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [4], are unsupervised: only the words
in the documents are modelled. The goal is to infer topics that maximize the likelihood (or the pos-
terior probability) of the collection. In this work, we develop supervised topic models, where each
document is paired with a response. The goal is to infer latent topics predictive of the response.
Given an unlabeled document, we infer its topic structure using a tted model, then form its pre-
diction. Note that the response is not limited to text categories. Other kinds of document-response
corpora include essays with their grades, movie reviews with their numerical ratings, and web pages
with counts of how many online community members liked them.
Unsupervised LDA has previously been used to construct features for classication. The hope was
that LDA topics would turn out to be useful for categorization, since they act to reduce data di-
mension [4]. However, when the goal is prediction, tting unsupervised topics may not be a good
choice. Consider predicting a movie rating from the words in its review. Intuitively, good predictive
topics will differentiate words like excellent, terrible, and average, without regard to genre.
But topics estimated from an unsupervised model may correspond to genres, if that is the dominant
structure in the corpus.
The distinction between unsupervised and supervised topic models is mirrored in existing
dimension-reduction techniques. For example, consider regression on unsupervised principal com-
ponents versus partial least squares and projection pursuit [7], which both search for covariate linear
combinations most predictive of a response variable. These linear supervised methods have non-

1

parametric analogs, such as an approach based on kernel ICA [6]. In text analysis, McCallum et al.
developed a joint topic model for words and categories [8], and Blei and Jordan developed an LDA
model to predict caption words from images [2]. In chemogenomic proling, Flaherty et al. [5]
proposed labelled LDA, which is also a joint topic model, but for genes and protein function
categories. It differs fundamentally from the model proposed here.
This paper is organized as follows. We rst develop the supervised latent Dirichlet allocation model
(sLDA) for document-response pairs. We derive parameter estimation and prediction algorithms for
the real-valued response case. Then we extend these techniques to handle diverse response types,
using generalized linear models. We demonstrate our approach on two real-world problems. First,
we use sLDA to predict movie ratings based on the text of the reviews. Second, we use sLDA to
predict the number of diggs that a web page will receive in the www.digg.com community, a
forum for sharing web content of mutual interest. The digg count prediction for a page is based
on the pages description in the forum. In both settings, we nd that sLDA provides much more
predictive power than regression on unsupervised LDA features. The sLDA approach also improves
on the lasso, a modern regularized regression technique.

2 Supervised latent Dirichlet allocation

In topic models, we treat the words of a document as arising from a set of latent topics, that is, a
set of unknown distributions over the vocabulary. Documents in a corpus share the same set of K
topics, but each document uses a mix of topics unique to itself. Thus, topic models are a relaxation
of classical document mixture models, which associate each document with a single unknown topic.
Here we build on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [4], a topic model that serves as the basis for
many others. In LDA, we treat the topic proportions for a document as a draw from a Dirichlet
distribution. We obtain the words in the document by repeatedly choosing a topic assignment from
those proportions, then drawing a word from the corresponding topic.
In supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), we add to LDA a response variable associated
with each document. As mentioned, this variable might be the number of stars given to a movie, a
count of the users in an on-line community who marked an article interesting, or the category of a
document. We jointly model the documents and the responses, in order to nd latent topics that will
best predict the response variables for future unlabeled documents.
We emphasize that sLDA accommodates various types of response: unconstrained real values, real
values constrained to be positive (e.g., failure times), ordered or unordered class labels, nonnegative
integers (e.g., count data), and other types. However, the machinery used to achieve this generality
complicates the presentation. So we rst give a complete derivation of sLDA for the special case
of an unconstrained real-valued response. Then, in Section 2.3, we present the general version of
sLDA, and explain how it handles diverse response types.
Focus now on the case y  R. Fix for a moment the model parameters: the K topics 1:K (each
k a vector of term probabilities), the Dirichlet parameter , and the response parameters  and  2.
Under the sLDA model, each document and response arises from the following generative process:

1. Draw topic proportions  |   Dir().
2. For each word

(a) Draw topic assignment zn |   Mult( ).
3. Draw response variable y | z1:N , ,  2  N(cid:0)>z,  2(cid:1).
(b) Draw word wn | zn, 1:K  Mult(zn
).

Here we dene z := (1/N )PN

n=1 zn. The family of probability distributions corresponding to this

generative process is depicted as a graphical model in Figure 1.
Notice the response comes from a normal linear model. The covariates in this model are the (un-
observed) empirical frequencies of the topics in the document. The regression coefcients on those
frequencies constitute . Note that a linear model usually includes an intercept term, which amounts
to adding a covariate that always equals one. Here, such a term is redundant, because the compo-
nents of z always sum to one.

2

By regressing the response on the empirical topic frequencies, we treat the response as non-
exchangeable with the words. The document (i.e., words and their topic assignments) is generated
rst, under full word exchangeability; then, based on the document, the response variable is gen-
erated. In contrast, one could formulate a model in which y is regressed on the topic proportions
. This treats the response and all the words as jointly exchangeable. But as a practical matter,
our chosen formulation seems more sensible: the response depends on the topic frequencies which
actually occurred in the document, rather than on the mean of the distribution generating the topics.
Moreover, estimating a fully exchangeable model with enough topics allows some topics to be used
entirely to explain the response variables, and others to be used to explain the word occurrences.
This degrades predictive performance, as demonstrated in [2].
We treat , 1:K , , and  2 as unknown constants to be estimated, rather than random variables. We
carry out approximate maximum-likelihood estimation using a variational expectation-maximization
(EM) procedure, which is the approach taken in unsupervised LDA as well [4].

2.1 Variational E-step

Given a document and response, the posterior distribution of the latent variables is

The normalizing value is the marginal probability of the observed data, i.e., the document w1:N and
response y. This normalizer is also known as the likelihood, or the evidence. As with LDA, it is not
efciently computable. Thus, we appeal to variational methods to approximate the posterior.
Variational objective function. We maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) L(), which for a
single document has the form

The central difference between LDA and sLDA lies in this update. As in LDA, the jth words
variational distribution over topics depends on the words topic probabilities under the actual model
(determined by 1:K ). But w j s variational distribution, and those of all other words, affect the
probability of the response, through the expected residual sum of squares (RSS), which is the second
term in (4). The end result is that the update (7) also encourages  j to decrease this expected RSS.
The update (7) depends on the variational parameters  j of all other words. Thus, unlike LDA, the
 j cannot be updated in parallel. Distinct occurrences of the same term are treated separately.

2.2 M-step and prediction

The corpus-level ELBO lower bounds the joint log likelihood across documents, which is the sum of
the per-document log-likelihoods. In the E-step, we estimate the approximate posterior distribution
for each document-response pair using the variational inference algorithm described above. In the
M-step, we maximize the corpus-level ELBO with respect to the model parameters 1:K , , and  2.
For our purposes, it sufces simply to x  to 1/K times the ones vector. In this section, we add
document indexes to the previous sections quantities, so y becomes yd and Z becomes Zd.
Estimating the topics. The M-step updates of the topics 1:K are the same as for unsupervised
LDA, where the probability of a word under a topic is proportional to the expected number of times
that it was assigned to that topic [4],

Prediction. Our focus in applying sLDA is prediction. Specically, we wish to compute the ex-
pected response value, given a new document w1:N and a tted model {, 1:K , ,  2}:

E[Y | w1:N , , 1:K , ,  2] = >

E[ Z | w1:N , , 1:K ].

(12)
The identity follows easily from iterated expectation. We approximate the posterior mean of Z using
the variational inference procedure of the previous section. But here, the terms depending on y are
removed from the  j update in (7). Notice this is the same as variational inference for unsupervised
LDA: since we averaged the response variable out of the right-hand side in (12), what remains is the
standard unsupervised LDA model for Z1:N and .
Thus, given a new document, we rst compute Eq[Z1:N ], the variational posterior distribution of the
latent variables Zn. Then, we estimate the response with

2.3 Diverse response types via generalized linear models

Eq[ Z] = > .

(13)

Up to this point, we have conned our attention to an unconstrained real-valued response variable.
In many applications, however, we need to predict a categorical label, or a non-negative integral
count, or a response with other kinds of constraints. Sometimes it is reasonable to apply a normal
linear model to a suitably transformed version of such a response. When no transformation results
in approximate normality, statisticians often make use of a generalized linear model, or GLM [9].
In this section, we describe sLDA in full generality, replacing the normal linear model of the earlier
exposition with a GLM formulation. As we shall see, the result is a generic framework which can be
specialized in a straightforward way to supervised topic models having a variety of response types.
There are two main ingredients in a GLM: the random component and the systematic compo-
nent. For the random component, one takes the distribution of the response to be an exponential
dispersion family with natural parameter  and dispersion parameter :

p(y | , ) = h(y, ) exp

.

(14)

(cid:26)  y  A( )

(cid:27)



For each xed , (14) is an exponential family, with base measure h(y, ), sufcient statistic y,
and log-normalizer A( ). The dispersion parameter provides additional exibility in modeling the
variance of y. Note that (14) need not be an exponential family jointly in (, ).

5

In the systematic component of the GLM, we relate the exponential-family parameter  of the ran-
dom component to a linear combination of covariates  the so-called linear predictor. For sLDA,
the linear predictor is >z. In fact, we simply set  = >z. Thus, in the general version of sLDA,
the previous specication in step 3 of the generative process is replaced with

so that

p(y | z1:N , , ) = h(y, ) exp

E[log p(y | Z1:N , , )] = log h(y, ) + 1

The reader familiar with GLMs will recognize that our choice of systematic component means sLDA
uses only canonical link functions. In future work, we will relax this constraint.
We now have the exibility to model any type of response variable whose distribution can be written
in exponential dispersion form (14). As is well known, this includes many commonly used distribu-
tions: the normal; the binomial (for binary response); the Poisson and negative binomial (for count
data); the gamma, Weibull, and inverse Gaussian (for failure time data); and others. Each of these

distributions corresponds to a particular choice of h(y, ) and A( ). For example, it is easy to show
that the normal distribution corresponds to h(y, ) = (1/
2 ) exp{y2/(2)} and A( ) =  2/2.
In this case, the usual parameters  and  2 just equal  and , respectively.

Variational E-step. The distribution of y appears only in the cross-entropy term (4). Its form under
the GLM is
= E[log  |  ]+E[log p(w j | 1:K )]log  j +1+(cid:16) y

This changes the coordinate ascent step for each  j , but the variational optimization is otherwise
unaffected. In particular, the gradient of the ELBO with respect to  j becomes
L
 j
Thus, the key to variational inference in sLDA is obtaining the gradient of the expected GLM log-
normalizer. Sometimes there is an exact expression, such as the normal case of Section 2. As another
example, the Poisson GLM leads to an exact gradient, which we omit for brevity.
Other times, no exact gradient is available. In a longer paper [3], we study two methods for this
situation. First, we can replace E[A(> Z )] with an adjustable lower bound whose gradient is
known exactly; then we maximize over the original variational parameters plus the parameter con-
trolling the bound. Alternatively, an application of the multivariate delta method for moments [1],
plus standard exponential family theory, shows

E(cid:2)A(> Z )(cid:3)o

E(cid:2)A(> Z )(cid:3)  A(> ) + VarGLM(Y |  = > )  >

(19)
Here, VarGLM denotes the response variance under the GLM, given a specied value of the natu-
ral parameterin all standard cases, this variance is a closed-form function of  j . The variance-
covariance matrix of Z under q is already known in closed from from E[ Z] and (5). Thus, computing
/ j of (19) exactly is mechanical. However, using this approximation gives up the usual guaran-
tee that the ELBO lower bounds the marginal likelihood. We forgo details and further examples due
to space constraints.
The GLM contribution to the gradient determines whether the  j coordinate update itself has a
closed form, as it does in the normal case (7) and the Poisson case (omitted). If the update is not
closed-form, we use numerical optimization, supplying a gradient obtained from one of the methods
described in the previous paragraph.
Parameter estimation (M-step). The topic parameter estimates are given by (8), as before. For the
corpus-level ELBO, the gradient with respect to  becomes

Given that the rightmost summation has been evaluated, exactly or approximately, during the

obtain new either in closed form or via one-dimensional numerical optimization.
Prediction. We form predictions just as in Section 2.2. The difference is that we now approximate
the expected response value of a test document as

E[Y | w1:N , , 1:K , , ]  Eq[(> Z )].

(22)

Again, this follows from iterated expectation plus the variational approximation. When the varia-
tional expectation cannot be computed exactly, we apply the approximation methods we relied on
for the GLM E-step and M-step. We defer specics to [3].

3 Empirical results

We evaluated sLDA on two prediction problems. First, we consider sentiment analysis of news-
paper movie reviews. We use the publicly available data introduced in [10], which contains movie
reviews paired with the number of stars given. While Pang and Lee treat this as a classication
problem, we treat it as a regression problem. With a 5000-term vocabulary chosen by tf-idf, the
corpus contains 5006 documents and comprises 1.6M words.
Second, we introduce the problem of predicting web page popularity on Digg.com. Digg is a com-
munity of users who share links to pages by submitting them to the Digg homepage, with a short
description. Once submitted, other users digg the links they like. Links are sorted on the Digg
homepage by the number of diggs they have received. Our Digg data set contains a year of link
descriptions, paired with the number of diggs each received during its rst week on the homepage.
(This corpus will be made publicly available at publication.) We restrict our attention to links in the
technology category. After trimming the top ten outliers, and using a 4145-term vocabulary chosen
by tf-idf, the Digg corpus contains 4078 documents and comprises 94K words.
For both sets of response variables, we transformed to approximate normality by taking logs. This
makes the data amenable to the continuous-response model of Section 2; for these two problems,
generalized linear modeling turned out to be unnecessary. We initialized 1:K to uniform topics,  2
to the sample variance of the response, and  to a grid on [1, 1] in increments of 2/K . We ran EM
until the relative change in the corpus-level likelihood bound was less than 0.01%. In the E-step,
we ran coordinate-ascent variational inference for each document until the relative change in the

We compared sLDA to linear regression on the d from unsupervised LDA. This is the regression
equivalent of using LDA topics as classication features [4].Figure 2 (L) illustrates that sLDA pro-
vides improved predictions on both data sets. Moreover, this improvement does not come at the cost
of document model quality. The per-word hold-out likelihood comparison in Figure 2 (R) shows that
sLDA ts the document data as well or better than LDA. Note that Digg prediction is signicantly
harder than the movie review sentiment prediction, and that the homogeneity of Digg technology
content leads the model to favor a small number of topics.
Finally, we compared sLDA to the lasso, which is L1-regularized least-squares regression. The
lasso is a widely used prediction method for high-dimensional problems. We used each documents
empirical distribution over words as its lasso covariates, setting the lasso complexity parameter with
5-fold CV. On Digg data, the lassos optimal model complexity yielded a CV pR2 of 0.088. The best
sLDA pR2 was 0.095, an 8.0% relative improvement. On movie data, the best Lasso pR2 was 0.457
versus 0.500 for sLDA, a 9.4% relative improvement. Note moreover that the Lasso provides only a
prediction rule, whereas sLDA models latent structure useful for other purposes.

4 Discussion

We have developed sLDA, a statistical model of labelled documents. The model accommodates the
different types of response variable commonly encountered in practice. We presented a variational
procedure for approximate posterior inference, which we then incorporated in an EM algorithm
for maximum-likelihood parameter estimation. We studied the models predictive performance on
two real-world problems. In both cases, we found that sLDA moderately improved on the lasso,
a state-of-the-art regularized regression method. Moreover, the topic structure recovered by sLDA
had higher hold-out likelihood than LDA on one problem, and equivalent hold-out likelihood on the
other. These results illustrate the benets of supervised dimension reduction when prediction is the
ultimate goal.
