ABSTRACT

Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine transla-
tion. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine
translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to
maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neu-
ral machine translation often belong to a family of encoderdecoders and encode
a source sentence into a xed-length vector from which a decoder generates a
translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a xed-length vector is a
bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoderdecoder architec-
ture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search
for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without
having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach,
we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art
phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore,
qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree
well with our intuition.

INTRODUCTION

Neural machine translation is a newly emerging approach to machine translation, recently proposed
by Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013), Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014b). Unlike the
traditional phrase-based translation system (see, e.g., Koehn et al., 2003) which consists of many
small sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation attempts to build and
train a single, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs a correct translation.
Most of the proposed neural machine translation models belong to a family of encoder
decoders (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014a), with an encoder and a decoder for each lan-
guage, or involve a language-specic encoder applied to each sentence whose outputs are then com-
pared (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014). An encoder neural network reads and encodes a source sen-
tence into a xed-length vector. A decoder then outputs a translation from the encoded vector. The
whole encoderdecoder system, which consists of the encoder and the decoder for a language pair,
is jointly trained to maximize the probability of a correct translation given a source sentence.
A potential issue with this encoderdecoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to
compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a xed-length vector. This may
make it difcult for the neural network to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer
than the sentences in the training corpus. Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of
a basic encoderdecoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases.
In order to address this issue, we introduce an extension to the encoderdecoder model which learns
to align and translate jointly. Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it
(soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is
concentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with
these source positions and all the previous generated target words.

The most important distinguishing feature of this approach from the basic encoderdecoder is that
it does not attempt to encode a whole input sentence into a single xed-length vector. Instead, it en-
codes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively
while decoding the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the
information of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a xed-length vector. We show this
allows a model to cope better with long sentences.
In this paper, we show that the proposed approach of jointly learning to align and translate achieves
signicantly improved translation performance over the basic encoderdecoder approach. The im-
provement is more apparent with longer sentences, but can be observed with sentences of any
length. On the task of English-to-French translation, the proposed approach achieves, with a single
model, a translation performance comparable, or close, to the conventional phrase-based system.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed model nds a linguistically plausible
(soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence.

2 BACKGROUND: NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION

From a probabilistic perspective, translation is equivalent to nding a target sentence y that max-
imizes the conditional probability of y given a source sentence x, i.e., arg maxy p(y | x).
In
neural machine translation, we t a parameterized model to maximize the conditional probability
of sentence pairs using a parallel training corpus. Once the conditional distribution is learned by a
translation model, given a source sentence a corresponding translation can be generated by searching
for the sentence that maximizes the conditional probability.
Recently, a number of papers have proposed the use of neural networks to directly learn this condi-
tional distribution (see, e.g., Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014a; Sutskever et al.,
2014; Cho et al., 2014b; Forcada and Neco, 1997). This neural machine translation approach typ-
ically consists of two components, the rst of which encodes a source sentence x and the second
decodes to a target sentence y. For instance, two recurrent neural networks (RNN) were used by
(Cho et al., 2014a) and (Sutskever et al., 2014) to encode a variable-length source sentence into a
xed-length vector and to decode the vector into a variable-length target sentence.
Despite being a quite new approach, neural machine translation has already shown promising results.
Sutskever et al. (2014) reported that the neural machine translation based on RNNs with long short-
term memory (LSTM) units achieves close to the state-of-the-art performance of the conventional
phrase-based machine translation system on an English-to-French translation task.1 Adding neural
components to existing translation systems, for instance, to score the phrase pairs in the phrase
table (Cho et al., 2014a) or to re-rank candidate translations (Sutskever et al., 2014), has allowed to
surpass the previous state-of-the-art performance level.

2.1 RNN ENCODERDECODER

Here, we describe briey the underlying framework, called RNN EncoderDecoder, proposed by
Cho et al. (2014a) and Sutskever et al. (2014) upon which we build a novel architecture that learns
to align and translate simultaneously.
In the EncoderDecoder framework, an encoder reads the input sentence, a sequence of vectors
x = (x1, , xTx ), into a vector c.2 The most common approach is to use an RNN such that

ht = f (xt, ht1)

(1)

and

where ht  Rn is a hidden state at time t, and c is a vector generated from the sequence of the
hidden states. f and q are some nonlinear functions. Sutskever et al. (2014) used an LSTM as f and
q ({h1, , hT}) = hT , for instance.

c = q ({h1, , hTx}) ,

1 We mean by the state-of-the-art performance, the performance of the conventional phrase-based system

without using any neural network-based component.

2 Although most of the previous works (see, e.g., Cho et al., 2014a; Sutskever et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner and
Blunsom, 2013) used to encode a variable-length input sentence into a xed-length vector, it is not necessary,
and even it may be benecial to have a variable-length vector, as we will show later.

The decoder is often trained to predict the next word yt(cid:48) given the context vector c and all the
previously predicted words {y1, , yt(cid:48)1}. In other words, the decoder denes a probability over
the translation y by decomposing the joint probability into the ordered conditionals:

T(cid:89)

t=1

where y =(cid:0)y1, , yTy

p(y) =

p(yt | {y1, , yt1} , c),

(cid:1). With an RNN, each conditional probability is modeled as

(2)

p(yt | {y1, , yt1} , c) = g(yt1, st, c),

(3)
where g is a nonlinear, potentially multi-layered, function that outputs the probability of yt, and st is
the hidden state of the RNN. It should be noted that other architectures such as a hybrid of an RNN
and a de-convolutional neural network can be used (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).

3 LEARNING TO ALIGN AND TRANSLATE

In this section, we propose a novel architecture for neural machine translation. The new architecture
consists of a bidirectional RNN as an encoder (Sec. 3.2) and a decoder that emulates searching
through a source sentence during decoding a translation (Sec. 3.1).

3.1 DECODER: GENERAL DESCRIPTION

In a new model architecture, we dene each conditional probability
in Eq. (2) as:

p(yi|y1, . . . , yi1, x) = g(yi1, si, ci),

(4)

where si is an RNN hidden state for time i, computed by

si = f (si1, yi1, ci).

It should be noted that unlike the existing encoderdecoder ap-
proach (see Eq. (2)), here the probability is conditioned on a distinct
context vector ci for each target word yi.
The context vector ci depends on a sequence of annotations
(h1, , hTx ) to which an encoder maps the input sentence. Each
annotation hi contains information about the whole input sequence
with a strong focus on the parts surrounding the i-th word of the
input sequence. We explain in detail how the annotations are com-
puted in the next section.
The context vector ci is, then, computed as a weighted sum of these
annotations hi:

ci =

ijhj.

tration of the proposed model

get word yt given a source

The weight ij of each annotation hj is computed by

(cid:80)Tx

k=1 exp (eik)

ij =

,

(6)

where

eij = a(si1, hj)

is an alignment model which scores how well the inputs around position j and the output at position
i match. The score is based on the RNN hidden state si1 (just before emitting yi, Eq. (4)) and the
j-th annotation hj of the input sentence.
We parametrize the alignment model a as a feedforward neural network which is jointly trained with
all the other components of the proposed system. Note that unlike in traditional machine translation,

the alignment is not considered to be a latent variable. Instead, the alignment model directly com-
putes a soft alignment, which allows the gradient of the cost function to be backpropagated through.
This gradient can be used to train the alignment model as well as the whole translation model jointly.
We can understand the approach of taking a weighted sum of all the annotations as computing an
expected annotation, where the expectation is over possible alignments. Let ij be a probability that
the target word yi is aligned to, or translated from, a source word xj. Then, the i-th context vector
ci is the expected annotation over all the annotations with probabilities ij.
The probability ij, or its associated energy eij, reects the importance of the annotation hj with
respect to the previous hidden state si1 in deciding the next state si and generating yi. Intuitively,
this implements a mechanism of attention in the decoder. The decoder decides parts of the source
sentence to pay attention to. By letting the decoder have an attention mechanism, we relieve the
encoder from the burden of having to encode all information in the source sentence into a xed-
length vector. With this new approach the information can be spread throughout the sequence of
annotations, which can be selectively retrieved by the decoder accordingly.

3.2 ENCODER: BIDIRECTIONAL RNN FOR ANNOTATING SEQUENCES

The usual RNN, described in Eq. (1), reads an input sequence x in order starting from the rst
symbol x1 to the last one xTx. However, in the proposed scheme, we would like the annotation
of each word to summarize not only the preceding words, but also the following words. Hence,
we propose to use a bidirectional RNN (BiRNN, Schuster and Paliwal, 1997), which has been
successfully used recently in speech recognition (see, e.g., Graves et al., 2013).

A BiRNN consists of forward and backward RNNs. The forward RNN
as it is ordered (from x1 to xTx) and calculates a sequence of forward hidden states (
The backward RNN
sequence of backward hidden states (


f reads the input sequence

h Tx ).

f reads the sequence in the reverse order (from xTx to x1), resulting in a

h Tx ).

We obtain an annotation for each word xj by concatenating the forward hidden state
h j and the
backward one
. In this way, the annotation hj contains the summaries
of both the preceding words and the following words. Due to the tendency of RNNs to better
represent recent inputs, the annotation hj will be focused on the words around xj. This sequence
of annotations is used by the decoder and the alignment model later to compute the context vector
(Eqs. (5)(6)).
See Fig. 1 for the graphical illustration of the proposed model.

4 EXPERIMENT SETTINGS

We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of English-to-French translation. We use the bilin-
gual, parallel corpora provided by ACL WMT 14.3 As a comparison, we also report the perfor-
mance of an RNN EncoderDecoder which was proposed recently by Cho et al. (2014a). We use
the same training procedures and the same dataset for both models.4

4.1 DATASET

WMT 14 contains the following English-French parallel corpora: Europarl (61M words), news
commentary (5.5M), UN (421M) and two crawled corpora of 90M and 272.5M words respectively,
totaling 850M words. Following the procedure described in Cho et al. (2014a), we reduce the size of
the combined corpus to have 348M words using the data selection method by Axelrod et al. (2011).5
We do not use any monolingual data other than the mentioned parallel corpora, although it may be
possible to use a much larger monolingual corpus to pretrain an encoder. We concatenate news-test-

2012 and news-test-2013 to make a development (validation) set, and evaluate the models on the test
set (news-test-2014) from WMT 14, which consists of 3003 sentences not present in the training
data.
After a usual tokenization6, we use a shortlist of 30,000 most frequent words in each language to
train our models. Any word not included in the shortlist is mapped to a special token ([UNK]). We
do not apply any other special preprocessing, such as lowercasing or stemming, to the data.

4.2 MODELS

We train two types of models. The rst one is an RNN EncoderDecoder (RNNencdec, Cho et al.,
2014a), and the other is the proposed model, to which we refer as RNNsearch. We train each model
twice: rst with the sentences of length up to 30 words (RNNencdec-30, RNNsearch-30) and then
with the sentences of length up to 50 word (RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50).
The encoder and decoder of the RNNencdec have 1000 hidden units each.7 The encoder of the
RNNsearch consists of forward and backward recurrent neural networks (RNN) each having 1000
hidden units. Its decoder has 1000 hidden units. In both cases, we use a multilayer network with a
single maxout (Goodfellow et al., 2013) hidden layer to compute the conditional probability of each
target word (Pascanu et al., 2014).
We use a minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm together with Adadelta (Zeiler,
2012) to train each model. Each SGD update direction is computed using a minibatch of 80 sen-
tences. We trained each model for approximately 5 days.
Once a model is trained, we use a beam search to nd a translation that approximately maximizes the
conditional probability (see, e.g., Graves, 2012; Boulanger-Lewandowski et al., 2013). Sutskever
et al. (2014) used this approach to generate translations from their neural machine translation model.
For more details on the architectures of the models and training procedure used in the experiments,
see Appendices A and B.

5 RESULTS

5.1 QUANTITATIVE RESULTS

In Table 1, we list the translation performances measured in BLEU score. It is clear from the table
that in all the cases, the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional RNNencdec. More
importantly, the performance of the RNNsearch is as high as that of the conventional phrase-based
translation system (Moses), when only the sentences consisting of known words are considered.
This is a signicant achievement, considering that Moses uses a separate monolingual corpus (418M
words) in addition to the parallel corpora we used to train the RNNsearch and RNNencdec.

6 We used the tokenization script from the open-source machine translation package, Moses.
7 In this paper, by a hidden unit, we always mean the gated hidden unit (see Appendix A.1.1).

One of the motivations behind the proposed approach was the use of a xed-length context vector
in the basic encoderdecoder approach. We conjectured that this limitation may make the basic
encoderdecoder approach to underperform with long sentences. In Fig. 2, we see that the perfor-
mance of RNNencdec dramatically drops as the length of the sentences increases. On the other hand,
both RNNsearch-30 and RNNsearch-50 are more robust to the length of the sentences. RNNsearch-
50, especially, shows no performance deterioration even with sentences of length 50 or more. This
superiority of the proposed model over the basic encoderdecoder is further conrmed by the fact
that the RNNsearch-30 even outperforms RNNencdec-50 (see Table 1).

5.2 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS

5.2.1 ALIGNMENT

The proposed approach provides an intuitive way to inspect the (soft-)alignment between the words
in a generated translation and those in a source sentence. This is done by visualizing the annotation
weights ij from Eq. (6), as in Fig. 3. Each row of a matrix in each plot indicates the weights
associated with the annotations. From this we see which positions in the source sentence were
considered more important when generating the target word.
We can see from the alignments in Fig. 3 that the alignment of words between English and French
is largely monotonic. We see strong weights along the diagonal of each matrix. However, we also
observe a number of non-trivial, non-monotonic alignments. Adjectives and nouns are typically
ordered differently between French and English, and we see an example in Fig. 3 (a). From this
gure, we see that the model correctly translates a phrase [European Economic Area] into [zone
economique europeen]. The RNNsearch was able to correctly align [zone] with [Area], jumping
over the two words ([European] and [Economic]), and then looked one word back at a time to
complete the whole phrase [zone economique europeenne].
The strength of the soft-alignment, opposed to a hard-alignment, is evident, for instance, from
Fig. 3 (d). Consider the source phrase [the man] which was translated into [l homme]. Any hard
alignment will map [the] to [l] and [man] to [homme]. This is not helpful for translation, as one
must consider the word following [the] to determine whether it should be translated into [le], [la],
[les] or [l]. Our soft-alignment solves this issue naturally by letting the model look at both [the] and
[man], and in this example, we see that the model was able to correctly translate [the] into [l]. We
observe similar behaviors in all the presented cases in Fig. 3. An additional benet of the soft align-
ment is that it naturally deals with source and target phrases of different lengths, without requiring a
counter-intuitive way of mapping some words to or from nowhere ([NULL]) (see, e.g., Chapters 4
and 5 of Koehn, 2010).

5.2.2 LONG SENTENCES

As clearly visible from Fig. 2 the proposed model (RNNsearch) is much better than the conventional
model (RNNencdec) at translating long sentences. This is likely due to the fact that the RNNsearch
does not require encoding a long sentence into a xed-length vector perfectly, but only accurately
encoding the parts of the input sentence that surround a particular word.
As an example, consider this source sentence from the test set:

An admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or
a medical centre to carry out a diagnosis or a procedure, based on his status as a
health care worker at a hospital.

The RNNencdec-50 translated this sentence into:

Un privil`ege dadmission est le droit dun medecin de reconnatre un patient `a
lhopital ou un centre medical dun diagnostic ou de prendre un diagnostic en
fonction de son etat de sante.

7

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015

The RNNencdec-50 correctly translated the source sentence until [a medical center]. However, from
there on (underlined), it deviated from the original meaning of the source sentence. For instance, it
replaced [based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital] in the source sentence with [en
fonction de son etat de sante] (based on his state of health).
On the other hand, the RNNsearch-50 generated the following correct translation, preserving the
whole meaning of the input sentence without omitting any details:

Un privil`ege dadmission est le droit dun medecin dadmettre un patient `a un
hopital ou un centre medical pour effectuer un diagnostic ou une procedure, selon
son statut de travailleur des soins de sante `a lhopital.

Let us consider another sentence from the test set:

This kind of experience is part of Disneys efforts to extend the lifetime of its
series and build new relationships with audiences via digital platforms that are
becoming ever more important, he added.

The translation by the RNNencdec-50 is

Ce type dexperience fait partie des initiatives du Disney pour prolonger la duree
de vie de ses nouvelles et de developper des liens avec les lecteurs numeriques qui
deviennent plus complexes.

As with the previous example, the RNNencdec began deviating from the actual meaning of the
source sentence after generating approximately 30 words (see the underlined phrase). After that
point, the quality of the translation deteriorates, with basic mistakes such as the lack of a closing
quotation mark.
Again, the RNNsearch-50 was able to translate this long sentence correctly:

Ce genre dexperience fait partie des efforts de Disney pour prolonger la duree
de vie de ses series et creer de nouvelles relations avec des publics via des
plateformes numeriques de plus en plus importantes, a-t-il ajoute.

In conjunction with the quantitative results presented already, these qualitative observations con-
rm our hypotheses that the RNNsearch architecture enables far more reliable translation of long
sentences than the standard RNNencdec model.
In Appendix C, we provide a few more sample translations of long source sentences generated by
the RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50 and Google Translate along with the reference translations.

6 RELATED WORK

6.1 LEARNING TO ALIGN

A similar approach of aligning an output symbol with an input symbol was proposed recently by
Graves (2013) in the context of handwriting synthesis. Handwriting synthesis is a task where the
model is asked to generate handwriting of a given sequence of characters. In his work, he used a
mixture of Gaussian kernels to compute the weights of the annotations, where the location, width
and mixture coefcient of each kernel was predicted from an alignment model. More specically,
his alignment was restricted to predict the location such that the location increases monotonically.
The main difference from our approach is that, in (Graves, 2013), the modes of the weights of the
annotations only move in one direction. In the context of machine translation, this is a severe limi-
tation, as (long-distance) reordering is often needed to generate a grammatically correct translation
(for instance, English-to-German).
Our approach, on the other hand, requires computing the annotation weight of every word in the
source sentence for each word in the translation. This drawback is not severe with the task of
translation in which most of input and output sentences are only 1540 words. However, this may
limit the applicability of the proposed scheme to other tasks.

6.2 NEURAL NETWORKS FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION

Since Bengio et al. (2003) introduced a neural probabilistic language model which uses a neural net-
work to model the conditional probability of a word given a xed number of the preceding words,
neural networks have widely been used in machine translation. However, the role of neural net-
works has been largely limited to simply providing a single feature to an existing statistical machine
translation system or to re-rank a list of candidate translations provided by an existing system.
For instance, Schwenk (2012) proposed using a feedforward neural network to compute the score of
a pair of source and target phrases and to use the score as an additional feature in the phrase-based
statistical machine translation system. More recently, Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) and Devlin
et al. (2014) reported the successful use of the neural networks as a sub-component of the existing
translation system. Traditionally, a neural network trained as a target-side language model has been
used to rescore or rerank a list of candidate translations (see, e.g., Schwenk et al., 2006).
Although the above approaches were shown to improve the translation performance over the state-
of-the-art machine translation systems, we are more interested in a more ambitious objective of
designing a completely new translation system based on neural networks. The neural machine trans-
lation approach we consider in this paper is therefore a radical departure from these earlier works.
Rather than using a neural network as a part of the existing system, our model works on its own and
generates a translation from a source sentence directly.

7 CONCLUSION

The conventional approach to neural machine translation, called an encoderdecoder approach, en-
codes a whole input sentence into a xed-length vector from which a translation will be decoded.
We conjectured that the use of a xed-length context vector is problematic for translating long sen-
tences, based on a recent empirical study reported by Cho et al. (2014b) and Pouget-Abadie et al.
(2014).
In this paper, we proposed a novel architecture that addresses this issue. We extended the basic
encoderdecoder by letting a model (soft-)search for a set of input words, or their annotations com-
puted by an encoder, when generating each target word. This frees the model from having to encode
a whole source sentence into a xed-length vector, and also lets the model focus only on information
relevant to the generation of the next target word. This has a major positive impact on the ability
of the neural machine translation system to yield good results on longer sentences. Unlike with
the traditional machine translation systems, all of the pieces of the translation system, including
the alignment mechanism, are jointly trained towards a better log-probability of producing correct
translations.
We tested the proposed model, called RNNsearch, on the task of English-to-French translation. The
experiment revealed that the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional encoderdecoder
model (RNNencdec) signicantly, regardless of the sentence length and that it is much more ro-
bust to the length of a source sentence. From the qualitative analysis where we investigated the
(soft-)alignment generated by the RNNsearch, we were able to conclude that the model can cor-
rectly align each target word with the relevant words, or their annotations, in the source sentence as
it generated a correct translation.
Perhaps more importantly, the proposed approach achieved a translation performance comparable to
the existing phrase-based statistical machine translation. It is a striking result, considering that the
proposed architecture, or the whole family of neural machine translation, has only been proposed
as recently as this year. We believe the architecture proposed here is a promising step toward better
machine translation and a better understanding of natural languages in general.
One of challenges left for the future is to better handle unknown, or rare words. This will be required
for the model to be more widely used and to match the performance of current state-of-the-art
machine translation systems in all contexts.
